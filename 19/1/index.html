      <h2>Chapter 19<br />
      Putting It All Together: Notes on the Structure of Lojban
      Texts</h2>

          <h3>1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>This chapter is incurably miscellaneous. It describes the
    cmavo that specify the structure of Lojban texts, from the
    largest scale (paragraphs) to the smallest (single words).
    There are fewer examples than are found in other chapters of
    this book, since the linguistic mechanisms described are
    generally made use of in conversation or else in long
    documents.</p>

    <p>This chapter is also not very self-contained. It makes
    passing reference to a great many concepts which are explained
    in full only in other chapters. The alternative would be a
    chapter on text structure which was as complex as all the other
    chapters put together. Lojban is a unified language, and it is
    not possible to understand any part of it (in full) before
    understanding every part of it (to some degree).</p>

    <p></p>
