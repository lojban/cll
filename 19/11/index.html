          <h3>11. Contrastive emphasis: BAhE</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ba'e    BAhE    emphasize next word
    za'e    BAhE    next word is nonce
</pre>

    <p>English often uses strong stress on a word to single it out
    for contrastive emphasis, thus</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">11.1)</a>    I saw George.
</pre>
    is quite different from 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">11.2)</a>    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>

    <p>The heavy stress on ``<i>George</i>'' (represented in
    writing by <i>italics</i>) indicates that I saw George rather
    than someone else. Lojban does not use stress in this way:
    stress is used only to help separate words (because every
    brivla is stressed on the penultimate syllable) and in names to
    match other languages' stress patterns. Note that many other
    languages do not use stress in this way either; typically word
    order is rearranged, producing something like</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">11.4)</a>    It was George whom I saw.
</pre>
    In Lojban, the cmavo ``ba'e'' (of selma'o BAhE) precedes a
    single word which is to be emphasized: 
<pre>
<a id="11-4.5" name="11-4.5">11.4.5)</a>    mi viska la ba'e .djordj.
    I saw the-one-named [emphasis] ``George''.
    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>

    <p>Note the pause before the name ``djordj.'', which serves to
    separate it unambiguously from the ``ba'e''. Alternatively, the
    ``ba'e'' can be moved to a position before the ``la'', which in
    effect emphasizes the whole construct ``la djordj.'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">11.5)</a>    mi viska ba'e la djordj.
    I saw [emphasis] the-one-named ``George''.
    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>
    Marking a word with a cmavo of BAhE does not change the word's
    grammar in any way. Any word in a bridi can receive contrastive
    emphasis marking: 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">11.6)</a>    ba'e mi viska la djordj.
    I, no one else, saw George.

<a id="7" name="7">11.7)</a> mi ba'e viska la djordj.
    I saw (not heard or smelled) George.
</pre>

    <p>Emphasis on one of the structural components of a Lojban
    bridi can also be achieved by rearranging it into an order that
    is not the speaker's or writer's usual order. Any sumti moved
    out of place, or the selbri when moved out of place, is
    emphatic to some degree.</p>

    <p>For completeness, the cmavo ``za'e'' should be mentioned,
    also of selma'o BAhE. It marks a word as possibly irregular,
    non-standard, or nonce (created for the occasion):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-8"
name="11-8">11.8)</a>    mi klama la za'e. .albeinias
    I go-to so-called Albania
</pre>
    marks a Lojbanization of an English name, where a more
    appropriate standard form might be something like ``la
    ctiipyris.'', reflecting the country's name in Albanian. 

    <p>Before a lujvo or fu'ivla, ``za'e'' indicates that the word
    has been made up on the spot and may be used in a sense that is
    not found in the unabridged dictionary (when we have an
    unabridged dictionary!).</p>
