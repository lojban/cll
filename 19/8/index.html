          <h3><a id="8" name="8">8. Attitude scope markers: FUhE/FUhO</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   fu'e    FUhE    open attitudinal scope
    fu'o    FUhO    close attitudinal scope
</pre>
    Lojban has a complex system of ``attitudinals'', words which
    indicate the speaker's attitude to what is being said. The
    attitudinals include indicators of emotion, intensity markers,
    discursives (which show the structure of discourse), and
    evidentials (which indicate ``how the speaker knows''). Most of
    these words belong to selma'o UI; the intensity markers belong
    to selma'o CAI for historical reasons, but the two selma'o are
    grammatically identical. The individual cmavo of UI and CAI are
    discussed in <a href="../../13/1/">Chapter 13</a>; only the
    rules for applying them in discourse are presented here. 

    <p>Normally, an attitudinal applies to the preceding word only.
    However, if the preceding word is a structural cmavo which
    begins or ends a whole construction, then that whole
    construction is affected by the attitudinal:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">8.1)</a>  mi viska le blanu .ia zdani [ku]
    I see the blue [belief] house.
    I see the house, which I believe to be blue.

<a id="8-2"
name="8-2">8.2)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani .ia [ku]
    I see the blue house [belief].
    I see the blue thing, which I believe to be a house.

<a id="8-3"
name="8-3">8.3)</a>   mi viska le .ia blanu zdani [ku]
    I see the [belief] blue house
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.

<a id="4" name="4">8.4)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani ku .ia
    I see (the blue house ) [belief]
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>An attitudinal meant to cover a whole sentence can be
    attached to the preceding ``.i'', expressed or understood:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">8.5)</a>  [.i] .ia mi viska le blanu zdani
    [belief] I see the blue house
    I believe I see a blue house.
</pre>
    or to an explicit ``vau'' placed at the end of a bridi. 

    <p>Likewise, an attitudinal meant to cover a whole paragraph
    can be attached to ``ni'o'' or ``no'i''. An attitudinal at the
    beginning of a text applies to the whole text.</p>

    <p>However, sometimes it is necessary to be more specific about
    the range of one or more attitudinals, particularly if the
    range crosses the boundaries of standard Lojban syntactic
    constructions. The cmavo ``fu'e'' (of selma'o FUhE) and
    ``fu'o'' (of selma'o FUhO) provide explicit scope markers.
    Placing ``fu'e'' in front of an attitudinal disconnects it from
    what precedes it, and instead says that it applies to all
    following words until further notice. The notice is given by
    ``fu'o'', which can appear anywhere and cancels all in-force
    attitudinals. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8-6"
name="8-6">8.6)</a>  mi viska le fu'e .ia blanu zdani fu'o ponse
    I see the [start] [belief] blue house [end] possessor
    I see the owner of what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>Here, only the ``blanu zdani'' portion of the three-part
    tanru ``blanu zdani ponse'' is marked as a belief of the
    speaker. Naturally, the attitudinal scope markers do not affect
    the rules for interpreting multi-part tanru: ``blanu zdani''
    groups first because tanru group from left to right unless
    overridden with ``ke'' or ``bo''.</p>

    <p>Other attitudinals of more local scope can appear after
    attitudinals marked by FUhE; these attitudinals are added to
    the globally active attitudinals rather than superseding
    them.</p>
