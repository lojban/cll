          <h3>13. Erasure: SI, SA, SU</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   si  SI  erase word
    sa  SA  erase phrase
    su  SU  erase discourse
</pre>
    The cmavo “si” (of selma'o SI) is a metalinguistic operator
    that erases the preceding word, as if it had never been spoken:
    
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">13.1)</a>    ti gerku si mlatu
    This is-a-dog, er, is-a-cat.
</pre>
    means the same thing as “ti mlatu”. Multiple “si” cmavo in
    succession erase the appropriate number of words: 
<pre>
<a id="13-2"
name="13-2">13.2)</a>    ta blanu zdani si si xekri zdani
    That is-a-blue house, er, er, is-a-black house.
</pre>
    In order to erase the word “zo”, it is necessary to use three
    “si” cmavo in a row: 
<pre>
<a id="13-3"
name="13-3">13.3)</a>    zo .bab. se cmene zo si si si la bab.
    The-word “Bob” is-the-name-of the word “si”, er, er, Bob.
</pre>

    <p>The first use of “si” does not erase anything, but
    completes the “zo” quotation. Two more “si” cmavo are then
    necessary to erase the first “si” and the “zo”.</p>

    <p>Incorrect names can likewise cause trouble with “si”:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">13.4)</a>    mi tavla fo la .esperanto
        si si .esperanton.
    I talk in-language that-named “and” “speranto”,
        er, er, Esperanto.
</pre>

    <p>The Lojbanized spelling “.esperanto” breaks up, as a
    consequence of the Lojban morphology rules (see <a
    href="../../4/1/">Chapter 4</a>) into two Lojban words, the
    cmavo “.e” and the undefined fu'ivla “speranto”. Therefore,
    two “si” cmavo are needed to erase them. Of course, “.e
    speranto” is not grammatical after “la”, but recognition of
    “si” is done before grammatical analysis.</p>

    <p>Even more messy is the result of an incorrect “zoi”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">13.5)</a>    mi cusku zoi fy. gy. .fy.
        si si si si zo .djan
    I express [foreign] [quote] “sy” [unquote],
        er, er, er, er, “John”.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../13/#5">Example 13.5</a>, the first “fy” is
    taken to be the delimiting word. The next word must be
    different from the delimiting word, and “gy.”, the Lojban
    name for the letter “g”, was chosen arbitrarily. Then the
    delimiting word must be repeated. For purposes of “si”
    erasure, the entire quoted text is taken to be a word, so four
    words have been uttered, and four more “si” cmavo are needed
    to erase them altogether. Similarly, a stray “lo'u” quotation
    mark must be erased with “fy. le'u si si si”, by completing
    the quotation and then erasing it all with three “si”
    cmavo.</p>

    <p>What if less than the entire “zo” or “zoi” construct is
    erased? The result is something which has a loose “zo” or
    “zoi” in it, without its expected sequels, and which is
    incurably ungrammatical. Thus, to erase just the word quoted by
    “zo”, it turns out to be necessary to erase the “zo” as
    well:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">13.6)</a>    mi se cmene zo .djan.
        si si zo .djordj.
    I am-named-by the-word “John”,
        er, er, the-word “George”.
</pre>

    <p>The parser will reject “zo .djan. si .djordj.”, because in
    that context “djordj.” is a name (of selma'o CMENE) rather
    than a quoted word.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement “si”
    erasure.</p>

    <p>As the above examples plainly show, precise erasures with
    “si” can be extremely hard to get right. Therefore, the cmavo
    “sa” (of selma'o SA) is provided for erasing more than one
    word. The cmavo following “sa” should be the starting marker
    of some grammatical construct. The effect of the “sa” is to
    erase back to and including the last starting marker of the
    same kind. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="13-7"
name="13-7">13.7)</a>    mi viska le sa .i mi cusku zo .djan.
    I see the  ...  I say the-word “John”.
</pre>

    <p>Since the word following “sa” is “.i”, the sentence
    separator, its effect is to erase the preceding sentence. So <a
    href="../13/#7">Example 13.7</a> is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">13.8)</a>    mi cusku zo .djan.
</pre>

    <p>Another example, erasing a partial description rather than a
    partial sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="13-9"
name="13-9">13.9)</a>    mi viska le blanu zdan. sa le xekri zdani
    I see the blue hou ...  the black house.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../13/#9">Example 13.9</a>, “le blanu zdan.” is
    ungrammatical, but clearly reflects the speaker’s original
    intention to say “le blanu zdani”. However, the “zdani” was
    cut off before the end and changed into a name. The entire
    ungrammatical “le” construct is erased and replaced by “le
    xekri zdani”.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement “sa”
    erasure. Getting “sa” right is even more difficult (for a
    computer) than getting “si” right, as the behavior of “si”
    is defined in terms of words rather than in terms of
    grammatical constructs (possibly incorrect ones) and words are
    conceptually simpler entities. On the other hand, “sa” is
    generally easier for human beings, because the rules for using
    it correctly are less finicky.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “su” (of selma'o SU) is yet another
    metalinguistic operator that erases the entire text. However,
    if the text involves multiple speakers, then “su” will only
    erase the remarks made by the one who said it, unless that
    speaker has said nothing. Therefore “susu” is needed to
    eradicate a whole discussion in conversation.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement either
    “su” or “susu” erasure.</p>
