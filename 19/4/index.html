          <h3>4. Topic-comment sentences: ZOhU</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:

<pre>
     zo'u    ZOhU    topic/comment separator
</pre>
</p>

    <p>The normal Lojban sentence is just a bridi, parallel to the
    normal English sentence which has a subject and a
    predicate:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>   mi klama le zarci
       I went to the market
</pre>

    In Chinese, the normal sentence form is different: a topic is
    stated, and a comment about it is made. (Japanese also has the
    concept of a topic, but indicates it by attaching a suffix;
    other languages also distinguish topics in various ways.) The
    topic says what the sentence is about: 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>   zhe<sup>4</sup> xiao<sup>1</sup>xi<sup>2</sup>   wo<sup>3</sup> zhi<sup>1</sup>dao le
       this news   I know [perfective]
       As for this news, I knew it.
       I’ve heard this news already.
</pre>

    The wide space in the first two versions of <a
    href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a> separate the topic (“this news”)
    from the comment (“I know already”).</p>

    <p>Lojban uses the cmavo “zo'u” (of selma'o ZOhU) to separate
    topic (a sumti) from comment (a bridi):

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>   le nuzba zu'o mi ba'o djuno
       The news : I [perfective] know.
</pre>

    <a href="../4/#3">Example 4.3</a> is the literal Lojban
    translation of <a href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a>. Of course, the
    topic-comment structure can be changed to a straightforward
    bridi structure: 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>   mi ba'o djuno le nuzba
       I [perfective] know the news.
</pre>

    <a href="../4/#4">Example 4.4</a> means the same as <a
    href="../4/#3">Example 4.3</a>, and it is simpler. However, often
    the position of the topic in the place structure of the selbri
    within the comment is vague: 

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">4.5)</a>   le finpe zo'u citka
       the fish : eat
</pre>

    Is the fish eating or being eaten? The sentence doesn’t say.
    The Chinese equivalent of <a href="../4/#5">Example 4.5</a>
    is:

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">4.6)</a>   yu<sup>2</sup> chi<sup>1</sup>
       fish   eat
</pre>

    which is vague in exactly the same way.</p>

    <p>Grammatically, it is possible to have more than one sumti
    before “zo'u”. This is not normally useful in topic-comment
    sentences, but is necessary in the other use of “zo'u”: to
    separate a quantifying section from a bridi containing
    quantified variables. This usage belongs to a discussion of
    quantifier logic in Lojban (see <a href="../../16/1/">Chapter
    16</a>), but an example would be:

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">4.7)</a>   roda poi prenu ku'o su'ode zo'u
           de patfu da
        for-all X which-are-persons, there-exists-a-Y such-that
           Y is the father of X.
        Every person has a father.
</pre>

    The string of sumti before “zo'u” (called the “prenex”:
    see <a href="../../16/1/">Chapter 16</a>) may contain both a
    topic and bound variables:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">4.8)</a>   loi patfu
            roda poi prenu ku'o su'ode zo'u
            de patfu da
       for-the-mass-of fathers
            for-all X which-are-persons, there-exists-a-Y such-that
            Y is the father of X.
       As for fathers, every person has one.
</pre>

    To specify a topic which affects more than one sentence, wrap
    the sentences in “tu'e ... tu'u” brackets and place the topic
    and the “zo'u” directly in front. This is the exception to
    the rule that a topic attaches directly to a sentence: 

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">4.9)</a>   loi jdini zo'u tu'e do ponse .inaja do djica [tu'u]
       the-mass-of money :  ( [if] you possess, then you want )
       Money: if you have it, you want it.
</pre>

    Note: In Lojban, you do not “want money”; you “want to
    have money” or something of the sort, as the x2 place of
    “djica” demands an event. As a result, the straightforward
    rendering of <a href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> without a topic is
    not:

<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">4.10)</a>  do ponse loi jdini .inaja do djica ri
       You possess money only-if you desire its-mere-existence
</pre>

    where “ri” means “loi jdini” and is interpreted as “the
    mere existence of money”, but rather: 

<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">4.11)</a>  do ponse loi jdini .inaja do djica tu'a ri
       You possess money only-if you desire something-about it
</pre>

    namely, the possession of money. But topic-comment sentences
    like <a href="../4/#9">Example 4.9</a> are inherently vague, and
    this difference between “ponse” (which expects a physical
    object in x2) and “djica” is ignored. See <a
    href="../9/#3">Example 9.3</a> for another topic/comment
    sentence.</p>

    <p>The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as
    well, but in Lojban the sumti in the x1 place is not
    necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal
    (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don’t
    necessarily have a “subject” in the English sense.</p>
