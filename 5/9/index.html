          <h3>9. Other kinds of simple selbri</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     go'i    GOhA                repeats the previous bridi
     du      GOhA                equality
     nu'a    NUhA                math operator to selbri
     moi     MOI                 changes number to ordinal selbri
     mei     MOI                 changes number to cardinal selbri
     nu      NU                  event abstraction
     kei     KEI                 terminator for NU
</pre>
</p>

    So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from
    brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other
    constructions in Lojban which are grammatically equivalent to
    brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as
    components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are
    discussed at length in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>, <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>, and <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>; but for completeness these
    types are mentioned here with a brief explanation and an
    example of their use in selbri. 

    <p>The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as
    pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi;
    none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member
    of GOhA is probably “go'i”, which amounts to a repetition of
    the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>   la djan. klama le zarci
       John goes-to the market.
</pre>

    you may retort:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>   la djan. go'i troci
       John [repeat last] are-a-tryer
       John tries to.
</pre>

    <a href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a> is short for:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>   la djan. klama be le zarci be'o troci
       John is-a-goer (to the market) type-of trier.
</pre>

    because the whole bridi of <a href="../9/#1">Example 9.1</a> has
    been packaged up into the single word “go'i” and inserted
    into <a href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a>.</p> 

    <p>The exceptional member of GOhA is “du”, which represents
    the relation of identity. Its place structure is:

<pre>
             x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...
</pre>

    for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o
    GOhA is available in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>. 

    <p>Lojban mathematical expressions (mekso) can be incorporated
    into selbri in two different ways. Mathematical operators such
    as “su'i”, meaning “plus”, can be transformed into selbri
    by prefixing them with “nu'a” (of selma'o NUhA). The
    resulting place structure is:</p>

<pre>
             x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments x2, x3, etc.
</pre>

    for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the
    x1 place because the number of following places may be
    indefinite.) For example: 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>   li vo nu'a su'i li re li re
       The-number 4 is-the-sum-of the-number 2 and-the-number 2.
</pre>

    A possible tanru example might be:

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>   mi jimpe tu'a nu'a su'i nabmi
       I understand something-about the-mass-of is-the-sum-of problems.
       I understand addition problems.
</pre>
</p>

    <p>More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical
    expression with a cmavo of selma'o MOI to create one of various
    numerical selbri. Details are available in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few tanru: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>   la prim. palvr. pamoi cusku
       Preem Palver is-the-1-th speaker.
       Preem Palver is the first speaker.

<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>   la an,iis. joi la .asun. bruna remei
       Anyi massed-with Asun are-a-brother type-of-twosome.
       Anyi and Asun are two brothers.
</pre>
</p>

    <p>Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a
    brivla is the abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are
    simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a bridi, followed by
    the elidable terminator “kei” of selma'o KEI. Semantically,
    abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of
    Lojban whose full ramifications are documented in <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>. A few examples: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">9.8)</a>   ti nu zdile kei kumfa
       This is-an-event-of amusement room.
       This is an amusement room.
</pre>

    <a href="../9/#8">Example 9.8</a> is quite distinct in meaning
    from: 

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">9.9)</a>   ti zdile kumfa
       This is-an-amuser room.
</pre>

    which suggests the meaning “a room that amuses someone”.</p>
