<h3>3. Three-part tanru grouping with “bo”</h3>
<p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     bo      BO                  closest scope grouping
</pre>
<p>Consider the English sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">3.1)</a>   That’s a little girls’ school.
</pre>
What does it mean? Two possible readings are:
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">3.2)</a>   That’s a little school for girls.

<a id="e3" name="e3">3.3)</a>   That’s a school for little girls.
</pre>
This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru ambiguity described in <a href="../2/">Section 2</a>. We understand that “girls’ school” means “a school where girls are the students”, and not “a school where girls are the teachers” or “a school which is a girl” (!). Likewise, we understand that “little girl” means “girl who is small”. This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is “girls’ school” to be taken as a unit, with “little” specifying the type of girls’ school? Or is “little girl” to be taken as a unit, specifying the type of school? In English speech, different tones of voice, or exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are used to make the distinction; English writing usually leaves it unrepresented.
<p>Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose; explicit words are used to do the work. The cmavo “bo” (which belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the two brivla which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban translation of <a href="../3/#e2">Example 3.2</a> would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">3.4)</a>   ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
       That is-a-small girl – school.
</pre>
<a href="../3/#e3">Example 3.3</a> might be translated:
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">3.5)</a>   ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
       That is-a-small – girl school.
</pre>
The “bo” is represented in the literal translation by a hyphen because in written English a hyphen is sometimes used for the same purpose: “a big dog-catcher” would be quite different from a “big-dog catcher” (presumably someone who catches only big dogs).
<p>Analysis of <a href="../3/#e4">Example 3.4</a> and <a href="../3/#e5">Example 3.5</a> reveals a tanru nested within a tanru. In <a href="../3/#e4">Example 3.4</a>, the main tanru has a seltau of “cmalu” and a tertau of “nixli bo ckule”; the tertau is itself a tanru with “nixli” as the seltau and “ckule” as the tertau. In <a href="../3/#e5">Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, the seltau is “cmalu bo nixli” (itself a tanru), whereas the tertau is “ckule”. This structure of tanru nested within tanru forms the basis for all the more complex types of selbri that will be explained below.</p>
<p>What about <a href="../3/#e6">Example 3.6</a>? What does it mean?</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6" name="e6">3.6)</a>   ta cmalu nixli ckule
       That is-a-small girl school.
</pre>
The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as the rules of English do with <a href="../3/#e1">Example 3.1</a>. The choice made by the language designers is to say that <a href="../3/#e6">Example 3.6</a> means the same as <a href="../3/#e5">Example 3.5</a>. This is true no matter what three brivla are used: the leftmost two are always grouped together. This rule is called the “left-grouping rule”. Left-grouping in seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common — though not universal — in other contexts in Lojban.
<p>Another way to express the English meaning of <a href="../3/#e4">Example 3.4</a> and <a href="../3/#e5">Example 3.5</a>, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7" name="e7">3.7)</a>   ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
       That is-a-small type-of (girl type-of school).

<a id="e8" name="e8">3.8)</a>   ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
       That is-a-(small type-of girl) type-of school.
</pre>
Because “type-of” is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it has no Lojban equivalent.
<p>Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert “bo” into a simple tanru:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9" name="e9">3.9)</a>   ta klama bo jubme
       That is-a goer–table.
</pre>
is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as <a href="../2/#e8">Example 2.8</a>, and is ambiguous in exactly the same ways. The cmavo “bo” serves only to resolve grouping ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity present in all tanru.
