<h3>13. Tenses and bridi negation</h3>
<p>A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the time, place, or mode of action. For example, in</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">13.1)</a>  mi pu klama le zarci
       I [past] go to-the market.
       I went to the market.
</pre>
the cmavo “pu” specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in <a href="../13/#e1">Example 13.1</a>. There are alternative ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are explained in <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a>, behave in the same way as tenses.
<p>Similarly, a bridi may have the particle “na” (of selma'o NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar negation of <a href="../12/">Section 12</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">13.2)</a>  la djonz. na pamoi cusku
       Jones (Not!) is-the-first speaker
       It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.
       Jones isn’t the first speaker.
</pre>
Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; <a href="../13/#e2">Example 13.2</a> doesn’t say. There are other ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the topic is explained fully in <a href="../../15/1/">Chapter 15</a>.
<p>Various combinations of tense and bridi negation cmavo are permitted. If both are expressed, either order is permissible with no change in meaning:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">13.3)</a>  mi na pu klama le zarci
       mi pu na klama le zarci
       It is false that I went to the market.
       I didn’t go to the market.
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to have more than one “na”, in which case pairs of “na” cmavo cancel out:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">13.4)</a>  mi na na klama le zarci
       It is false that it is false that I go to the market.
       I go to the market.
</pre>
<p>It is even possible, though somewhat pointless, to have multiple “na” cmavo and tense cmavo mixed together, subject to the limitation that two adjacent tense cmavo will be understood as a compound tense, and must fit the grammar of tenses as explained in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">13.5)</a>  mi na pu na ca klama le zarci
       I [not] [past] [not] [present] go to-the market
       It is not the case that in the past it was not the case that in the present I
               went to the market.
       I didn’t not go to the market.
       I went to the market.
</pre>
<p>Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the beginning of the selbri. They cannot be embedded within it.</p>
