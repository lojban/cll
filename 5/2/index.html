          <h3>2. Simple tanru</h3>

    <p>Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla
    placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more
    than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single
    English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English
    are combinations of two nouns such as “lemon tree”. There is
    no way to tell just by looking at the phrase “lemon tree”
    exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of
    “lemon” and “tree” by themselves. As English-speakers, we
    must simply know that it refers to “a tree which bears lemons
    as fruits”. A person who didn’t know English very well might
    think of it as analogous to “brown tree” and wonder, “What
    kind of tree is lemon-colored?”</p>

    <p>In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as
    English adjective- noun combinations like “big boy” and
    adverb-verb combinations like “quickly run”. This is a
    consequence of Lojban not having any such categories as
    “noun”, “verb”, “adjective”, or “adverb”. English words
    belonging to any of these categories are translated by simple
    brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples of tanru:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  tu pelnimre tricu
    that-yonder is-a-(lemon tree).
    That is a lemon tree.

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   la djan. barda nanla
    John is-a-big boy.
    John is a big boy.

<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>   mi sutra bajra
    I quick run.
    I quickly run/I run quickly.
</pre>

    <p>Note that “pelnimre” is a lujvo for “lemon”; it is
    derived from the gismu “pelxu”, yellow, and “nimre”,
    citrus. Note also that “sutra” can mean “fast/quick” or
    “quickly” depending on its use:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>  mi sutra
    I am-fast/quick.
</pre>
    shows “sutra” used to translate an adjective, whereas in <a
    href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> it is translating an adverb.
    (Another correct translation of <a href="../2/#3">Example
    2.3</a>, however, would be “I am a quick runner”.) 

    <p>There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a
    tanru, derived from the place structure of the word “tanru”.
    The first component is called the “seltau”, and the second
    component is called the “tertau”.</p>

    <p>The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is
    that the tertau carries the primary meaning. A “pelnimre
    tricu” is primarily a tree, and only secondarily is it
    connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an
    alternative translation of <a href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>
    would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>  That is a lemon type of tree.
</pre>

    <p>This “type of” relationship between the components of a
    tanru is fundamental to the tanru concept.</p>

    <p>We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the
    tertau:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>  That is a tree which is lemon-ish
        (in the way appropriate to trees)
</pre>
    would be another possible translation of <a
    href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>. In the same way, a more explicit
    translation of <a href="../2/#2">Example 2.2</a> might be: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">2.7)</a>  John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
</pre>

    <p>This “way that boys are big” would be quite different from
    the way in which elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is
    small-for-an-elephant.</p>

    <p>All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations
    of:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">2.8)</a>  ta klama jubme
    That is-a-goer type-of-table.
</pre>
    include: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps).
      That is a table owned by one who goes. That is a table used
      by those who go (a sports doctor’s table?). That is a table
      when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).</dd>
    </dl>
    In each case the object referred to is a “goer type of
    table”, but the ambiguous “type of” relationship can mean
    one of many things. A speaker who uses tanru (and pragmatically
    all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood. Using
    tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the
    circumlocution required to squeeze out all ambiguity can
    require too much effort. 

    <p>No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru
    exists; probably no such theory can exist. However, some
    regularities obviously do exist:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">2.9)</a>  do barda prenu
    You are-a-large person.

<a id="10" name="10">2.10)</a> do cmalu prenu
    You are-a-small person.
</pre>
    are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between
    “barda” and “prenu” is the same as that between “cmalu”
    and “prenu”. <a href=../14/>Section 14</a> and <a
    href=../15/>Section 15</a> contain a partial listing of some
    types of tanru, with examples.
