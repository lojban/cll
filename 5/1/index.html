<h2>Chapter 5<br />
“Pretty Little Girls’ School”: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</h2>
<h3>1. Lojban content words: brivla</h3>
<p>At the center, logically and often physically, of every Lojban bridi is one or more words which constitute the selbri. A bridi expresses a relationship between things: the selbri specifies which relationship is referred to. The difference between:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">1.1)</a>   do mamta mi
       You are-a-mother-of me.
       You are my mother.
</pre>
and
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">1.2)</a>   do patfu mi
       You are-a-father-of me.
       You are my father.
</pre>
lies in the different selbri.
<p>The simplest kind of selbri is a single Lojban content word: a brivla. There are three different varieties of brivla: those which are built into the language (the gismu), those which are derived from combinations of the gismu (the lujvo), and those which are taken (usually in a modified form) from other languages (the fu'ivla). In addition, there are a few cmavo that can act like brivla; these are mentioned in <a href="../9/">Section 9</a>, and discussed in full in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, however, all brivla are alike. For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">1.3)</a>   ta bloti
       That is-a-boat.
       That is a boat.

<a id="e4" name="e4">1.4)</a>   ta brablo
       That is-a-large-boat.
       That is a ship.

<a id="e5" name="e5">1.5)</a>   ta blotrskunri
       That is-a-(boat)-schooner.
       That is a schooner.
</pre>
illustrate the three types of brivla (gismu, lujvo, and fu'ivla respectively), but in each case the selbri is composed of a single word whose meaning can be learned independent of its origins.
<p>The remainder of this chapter will mostly use gismu as example brivla, because they are short. However, it is important to keep in mind that wherever a gismu appears, it could be replaced by any other kind of brivla.</p>
