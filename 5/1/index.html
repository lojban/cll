<h2>Chapter 5<br />
      ``Pretty Little Girls' School'': The Structure Of Lojban
      selbri</h2>

          <h3><a id="1" name="1">1. Lojban content words: brivla</h3>

    <p>At the center, logically and often physically, of every
    Lojban bridi is one or more words which constitute the selbri.
    A bridi expresses a relationship between things: the selbri
    specifies which relationship is referred to. The difference
    between:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  do mamta mi
    You are-a-mother-of me.
    You are my mother.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">1.2)</a>  do patfu mi
    You are-a-father-of me.
    You are my father.
</pre>
    lies in the different selbri. 

    <p>The simplest kind of selbri is a single Lojban content word:
    a brivla. There are three different varieties of brivla: those
    which are built into the language (the gismu), those which are
    derived from combinations of the gismu (the lujvo), and those
    which are taken (usually in a modified form) from other
    languages (the fu'ivla). In addition, there are a few cmavo
    that can act like brivla; these are mentioned in <a
    href=../9/>Section 9</a>, and discussed in full in <a
    href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of this chapter, however, all brivla are
    alike. For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">1.3)</a>  ta bloti
    That is-a-boat.
    That is a boat.

<a id="4" name="4">1.4)</a>   ta brablo
    that is-a-large-boat.
    That is a ship.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">1.5)</a>  ta blotrskunri
    That is-a-(boat)-schooner.
    That is a schooner.
</pre>
    illustrate the three types of brivla (gismu, lujvo, and fu'ivla
    respectively), but in each case the selbri is composed of a
    single word whose meaning can be learned independent of its
    origins. 

    <p>The remainder of this chapter will mostly use gismu as
    example brivla, because they are short. However, it is
    important to keep in mind that wherever a gismu appears, it
    could be replaced by any other kind of brivla.</p>
