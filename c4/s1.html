    <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>Morphology is the part of grammar that deals with the form
    of words. Lojban's morphology is fairly simple compared to that
    of many languages, because Lojban words don't change form
    depending on how they are used. English has only a small number
    of such changes compared to languages like Russian, but we do
    have changes like ``boys'' as the plural of ``boy'', or
    ``walked'' as the past-tense form of ``walk''. To make plurals
    or past tenses in Lojban, you add separate words to the
    sentence that express the number of boys, or the time when the
    walking was going on.</p>

    <p>However, Lojban does have what is called ``derivational
    morphology'': the capability of building new words from old
    words. In addition, the form of words tells us something about
    their grammatical uses, and sometimes about the means by which
    they entered the language. Lojban has very orderly rules for
    the formation of words of various types, both the words that
    already exist and new words yet to be created by speakers and
    writers.</p>

    <p>A stream of Lojban sounds can be uniquely broken up into its
    component words according to specific rules. These so-called
    ``morphology rules'' are summarized in this chapter. (However,
    a detailed algorithm for breaking sounds into words has not yet
    been fully debugged, and so is not presented in this book.)
    First, here are some conventions used to talk about groups of
    Lojban letters, including vowels and consonants.</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>V represents any single Lojban vowel except ``y''; that
      is, it represents ``a'', ``e'', ``i'', ``o'', or ``u''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>VV represents either a diphthong, one of the
      following:</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>ai ei oi au</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>or a two-syllable vowel pair with an apostrophe
      separating the vowels, one of the following:</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>a'a a'e a'i a'o a'u e'a e'e e'i e'o e'u i'a i'e i'i i'o
      i'u o'a o'e o'i o'o o'u u'a u'e u'i u'o u'u</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>C represents a single Lojban consonant, not including the
      apostrophe, one of ``b'', ``c'', ``d'', ``f'', ``g'', ``j'',
      ``k'', ``l'', ``m'', ``n'', ``p'', ``r'', ``s'', ``t'',
      ``v'', ``x'', or ``z''. Syllabic ``l'', ``m'', ``n'', and
      ``r'' always count as consonants for the purposes of this
      chapter.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>CC represents two adjacent consonants of type C which
      constitute one of the 48 permissible initial consonant
      pairs:</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>bl br cf ck cl cm cn cp cr ct dj dr dz fl fr gl gr jb jd
      jg jm jv kl kr ml mr pl pr sf sk sl sm sn sp sr st tc tr ts
      vl vr xl xr zb zd zg zm zv</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>C/C represents two adjacent consonants which constitute
      one of the permissible consonant pairs (not necessarily a
      permissible initial consonant pair). The permissible
      consonant pairs are explained in <a href="../c3/s1.html">Chapter
      3</a>. In brief, any consonant pair is permissible unless it
      contains: two identical letters, both a voiced (excluding
      ``r'', ``l'', ``m'', ``n'') and and an unvoiced consonant, or
      is one of certain specified forbidden pairs.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>C/CC represents a consonant triple. The first two
      consonants must constitute a permissible consonant pair; the
      last two consonants must constitute a permissible initial
      consonant pair.</dd>
    </dl>
    Lojban has three basic word classes --- parts of speech --- in
    contrast to the eight that are traditional in English. These
    three classes are called cmavo, brivla, and cmene. Each of
    these classes has uniquely identifying properties --- an
    arrangement of letters that allows the word to be uniquely and
    unambiguously recognized as a separate word in a string of
    Lojban, upon either reading or hearing, and as belonging to a
    specific word-class. 

    <p>They are also functionally different: cmavo are the
    structure words, corresponding to English words like ``and'',
    ``if'', ``the'' and ``to''; brivla are the content words,
    corresponding to English words like ``come'', ``red'',
    ``doctor'', and ``freely''; cmene are proper names,
    corresponding to English ``James'', ``Afghanistan'', and ``Pope
    John Paul II''.</p>
