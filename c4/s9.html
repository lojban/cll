    <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Rules for inserting pauses</h3>

    <p>Summarized in one place, here are the rules for inserting
    pauses between Lojban words:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Any two words may have a pause between them; it is always
      illegal to pause in the middle of a word, because that breaks
      up the word into two words.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Every word ending in a consonant must be followed by a
      pause. Necessarily, all such words are cmene.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>Every word beginning with a vowel must be preceded by a
      pause. Such words are either cmavo, fu'ivla, or cmene; all
      gismu and lujvo begin with consonants.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>Every cmene must be preceded by a pause, unless the
      immediately preceding word is one of the cmavo ``la'',
      ``lai'', ``la'i'', or ``doi'' (which is why those strings are
      forbidden in cmene). However, the situation triggering this
      rule rarely occurs.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>If the last syllable of a word bears the stress, and a
      brivla follows, the two must be separated by a pause, to
      prevent confusion with the primary stress of the brivla. In
      this case, the first word must be either a cmavo or a cmene
      with unusual stress (which already ends with a pause, of
      course).</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>A cmavo of the form ``Cy'' must be followed by a pause
      unless another ``Cy''-form cmavo follows.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>7)</dt>

      <dd>When non-Lojban text is embedded in Lojban, it must be
      preceded and followed by pauses. (How to embed non-Lojban
      text is explained in <a href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter
      19</a>.)</dd>
