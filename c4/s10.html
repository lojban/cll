          <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. Considerations for making lujvo</h3>

    <p>Given a tanru which expresses an idea to be used frequently,
    it can be turned into a lujvo by following the lujvo-making
    algorithm which is given in <a href="s11.html">Section 11</a>.</p>

    <p>In building a lujvo, the first step is to replace each gismu
    with a rafsi that uniquely represents that gismu. These rafsi
    are then attached together by fixed rules that allow the
    resulting compound to be recognized as a single word and to be
    analyzed in only one way.</p>

    <p>There are three other complications; only one is
    serious.</p>

    <p>The first is that there is usually more than one rafsi that
    can be used for each gismu. The one to be used is simply
    whichever one sounds or looks best to the speaker or writer.
    There are usually many valid combinations of possible rafsi.
    They all are equally valid, and all of them mean exactly the
    same thing. (The scoring algorithm given in <a
    href="#s12">Section 12</a> is used to choose the standard form
    of the lujvo --- the version which would be entered into a
    dictionary.)</p>

    <p>The second complication is the serious one. Remember that a
    tanru is ambiguous --- it has several possible meanings. A
    lujvo, or at least one that would be put into the dictionary,
    has just a single meaning. Like a gismu, a lujvo is a predicate
    which encompasses one area of the semantic universe, with one
    set of places. Hopefully the meaning chosen is the most useful
    of the possible semantic spaces. A possible source of
    linguistic drift in Lojban is that as Lojbanic society evolves,
    the concept that seems the most useful one may change.</p>

    <p>You must also be aware of the possibility of some prior
    meaning of a new lujvo, especially if you are writing for
    posterity. If a lujvo is invented which involves the same tanru
    as one that is in the dictionary, and is assigned a different
    meaning (or even just a different place structure), linguistic
    drift results. This isn't necessarily bad. Every natural
    language does it. But in communication, when you use a meaning
    different from the dictionary definition, someone else may use
    the dictionary and therefore misunderstand you. You can use the
    cmavo ``za'e'' (explained in <a href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter
    19</a>) before a newly coined lujvo to indicate that it may
    have a non-dictionary meaning.</p>

    <p>The essential nature of human communication is that if the
    listener understands, then all is well. Let this be the
    ultimate guideline for choosing meanings and place structures
    for invented lujvo.</p>

    <p>The third complication is also simple, but tends to scare
    new Lojbanists with its implications. It is based on Zipf's
    Law, which says that the length of words is inversely
    proportional to their usage. The shortest words are those which
    are used more; the longest ones are used less. Conversely,
    commonly used concepts will be tend to be abbreviated. In
    English, we have abbreviations and acronyms and jargon, all of
    which represent complex ideas that are used often by small
    groups of people, so they shortened them to convey more
    information more rapidly.</p>

    <p>Therefore, given a complicated tanru with grouping markers,
    abstraction markers, and other cmavo in it to make it
    syntactically unambiguous, the psychological basis of Zipf's
    Law may compel the lujvo-maker to drop some of the cmavo to
    make a shorter (technically incorrect) tanru, and then use that
    tanru to make the lujvo.</p>

    <p>This doesn't lead to ambiguity, as it might seem to. A given
    lujvo still has exactly one meaning and place structure. It is
    just that more than one tanru is competing for the same lujvo.
    But more than one meaning for the tanru was already competing
    for the ``right'' to define the meaning of the lujvo. Someone
    has to use judgment in deciding which one meaning is to be
    chosen over the others.</p>

    <p>If the lujvo made by a shorter form of tanru is in use, or
    is likely to be useful for another meaning, the decider then
    retains one or more of the cmavo, preferably ones that set this
    meaning apart from the shorter form meaning that is used or
    anticipated. As a rule, therefore, the shorter lujvo will be
    used for a more general concept, possibly even instead of a
    more frequent word. If both words are needed, the simpler one
    should be shorter. It is easier to add a cmavo to clarify the
    meaning of the more complex term than it is to find a good
    alternate tanru for the simpler term.</p>

    <p>And of course, we have to consider the listener. On hearing
    an unknown word, the listener will decompose it and get a tanru
    that makes no sense or the wrong sense for the context. If the
    listener realizes that the grouping operators may have been
    dropped out, he or she may try alternate groupings, or try
    inserting an abstraction operator if that seems plausible. (The
    grouping of tanru is explained in <a href="../c5/s1.html">Chapter
    5</a>; abstraction is explained in <a
    href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a>.) Plausibility is the key to
    learning new ideas and to evaluating unfamiliar lujvo.</p>
