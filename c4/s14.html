    <h3><a id="s14" name="s14">14. The gismu creation algorithm</h3>

    <p>The gismu were created through the following process:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>At least one word was found in each of the six source
      languages (Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, Arabic)
      corresponding to the proposed gismu. This word was rendered
      into Lojban phonetics rather liberally: consonant clusters
      consisting of a stop and the corresponding fricative were
      simplified to just the fricative (``tc'' became ``c'', ``dj''
      became ``j'') and non-Lojban vowels were mapped onto Lojban
      ones. Furthermore, morphological endings were dropped. The
      same mapping rules were applied to all six languages for the
      sake of consistency.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>All possible gismu forms were matched against the six
      source-language forms. The matches were scored as
      follows:</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2a)</dt>

      <dd>If three or more letters were the same in the proposed
      gismu and the source-language word, and appeared in the same
      order, the score was equal to the number of letters that were
      the same. Intervening letters, if any, did not matter.</dd>

      <dt>2b)</dt>

      <dd>If exactly two letters were the same in the proposed
      gismu and the source-language word, and either the two
      letters were consecutive in both words, or were separated by
      a single letter in both words, the score was 2. Letters in
      reversed order got no score.</dd>

      <dt>2c)</dt>

      <dd>Otherwise, the score was 0.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>The scores were divided by the length of the
      source-language word in its Lojbanized form, and then
      multiplied by a weighting value specific to each language,
      reflecting the proportional number of first-language and
      second-language speakers of the language. (Second-language
      speakers were reckoned at half their actual numbers.) The
      weights were chosen to sum to 1.00. The sum of the weighted
      scores was the total score for the proposed gismu form.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>Any gismu forms that conflicted with existing gismu were
      removed. Obviously, being identical with an existing gismu
      constitutes a conflict. In addition, a proposed gismu that
      was identical to an existing gismu except for the final vowel
      was considered a conflict, since two such gismu would have
      identical 4-letter rafsi.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>More subtly: If the proposed gismu was identical to an
      existing gismu except for a single consonant, and the
      consonant was ``too similar'' based on the following table,
      then the proposed gismu was rejected.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>proposed gismu existing gismu</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>b p, v c j, s d t f p, v g k, x j c, z k g, x l r m n n m
      p b, f r l s c, z t d v b, f x g, k z j, s</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>See <a href="s4.html">Section 4</a> for an example.</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>The gismu form with the highest score usually became the
      actual gismu. Sometimes a lower-scoring form was used to
      provide a better rafsi. A few gismu were changed in error as
      a result of transcription blunders (for example, the gismu
      ``gismu'' should have been ``gicmu'', but it's too late to
      fix it now).</dd>
    </dl>
    The language weights used to make most of the gismu were as
    follows: 
<pre>
   Chinese     0.36
    English     0.21
    Hindi       0.16
    Spanish     0.11
    Russian     0.09
    Arabic      0.07
</pre>
    reflecting 1985 number-of-speakers data. A few gismu were made
    much later 

    <dl>
      <dt>using updated weights:</dt>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Chinese 0.347 Hindi 0.196 English 0.160 Spanish 0.123
      Russian 0.089 Arabic 0.085</dd>
    </dl>
    (English and Hindi switched places due to demographic changes.)
    

    <p>Note that the stressed vowel of the gismu was considered
    sufficiently distinctive that two or more gismu may differ only
    in this vowel; as an extreme example, ``bradi'', ``bredi'',
    ``bridi'', and ``brodi'' (but fortunately not ``brudi'') are
    all existing gismu.</p>
