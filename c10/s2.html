          <h3><a id="s2" name="s2">2. Spatial tenses: FAhA and VA</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   vi  VA  short distance
    va  VA  medium distance
    vu  VA  long distance

    zu'a    FAhA    left
    ri'u    FAhA    right
    ga'u    FAhA    up
    ni'a    FAhA    down
    ca'u    FAhA    front
    ne'i    FAhA    within
    be'a    FAhA    north of
</pre>
    (The complete list of FAhA cmavo can be found in <a
    href="#s27">Section 27</a>.) 

    <p>Why is this section about spatial tenses rather than the
    more familiar time tenses of <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, asks
    the reader? Because the model to be used in explaining both
    will be easier to grasp for space than for time. The
    explanation of time tenses will resume in <a href="#s4">Section
    4</a>.</p>

    <p>English doesn't have mandatory spatial tenses. Although
    there are plenty of ways in English of showing where an event
    happens, there is absolutely no need to do so. Considering this
    fact may give the reader a feel for what the optional Lojban
    time tenses are like. From the Lojban point of view, space and
    time are interchangeable, although they are not treated
    identically.</p>

    <p>Lojban specifies the spatial tense of a bridi (the place at
    which it occurs) by using words from selma'o FAhA and VA to
    describe an imaginary journey from the speaker to the place
    referred to. FAhA cmavo specify the direction taken in the
    journey, whereas VA cmavo specify the distance gone. For
    example:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  le nanmu va batci le gerku
    The man [medium distance] bites the dog.
    Over there the man is biting the dog.
</pre>
    What is at a medium distance? The event referred to by the
    bridi: the man biting the dog. What is this event at a medium
    distance from? The speaker's location. We can understand the
    ``va'' as saying: ``If you want to get from the speaker's
    location to the location of the bridi, journey for a medium
    distance (in some direction unspecified).'' This ``imaginary
    journey'' can be used to understand not only <a
    href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>, but also every other spatial
    tense construct. 

    <p>Suppose you specify a direction with a FAhA cmavo, rather
    than a distance with a VA cmavo:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  le nanmu zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [left] bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Here the imaginary journey is again from the speaker's
    location to the location of the bridi, but it is now performed
    by going to the left (in the speaker's reference frame) for an
    unspecified distance. So a reasonable translation is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>To my left, the man bites the dog.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The ``my'' does not have an explicit equivalent in the
    Lojban, because the speaker's location is understood as the
    starting point.</p>

    <p>(Etymologically, by the way, ``zu'a'' is derived from
    ``zunle'', the gismu for ``left'', whereas ``vi'', ``va'', and
    ``vu'' are intended to be reminiscent of ``ti'', ``ta'', and
    ``tu'', the demonstrative pronouns ``this-here'',
    ``that-there'', and ``that-yonder''.)</p>

    <p>What about specifying both a direction and a distance? The
    rule here is that the direction must come before the
    distance:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  le nanmu zu'avi batci le gerku
    The man [left] [short distance] bites the dog.
    Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>As explained in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, it would be
    perfectly correct to use ``ku'' to move this tense to the
    beginning or the end of the sentence to emphasize it:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d4"
name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  zu'aviku le nanmu cu batci le gerku
    [Left] [short distance] the man bites the dog.
    Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre>
