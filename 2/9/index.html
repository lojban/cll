        <h3>9. tanru</h3>

  <p>When two gismu are adjacent, the first one modifies the
  second, and the selbri takes its place structure from the
  rightmost word. Such combinations of gismu are called “tanru”.
  For example,</p>

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  sutra tavla
</pre>

  has the place structure 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  x1 is a fast type-of talker to x2
about x3
        in language x4
    x1 talks fast to x2 about x3 in language x4
</pre>

  When three or more gismu are in a row, the first modifies the
  second, and that combined meaning modifies the third, and that
  combined meaning modifies the fourth, and so on. For example 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  sutra tavla cutci
</pre>

  has the place structure 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>  s1 is a fast-talker type of shoe
        worn by s2 of material s3
</pre>

  <p>That is, it is a shoe that is worn by a fast talker rather
  than a shoe that is fast and is also worn by a talker.</p>

  <p>Note especially the use of “type-of” as a mechanism for
  connecting the English translations of the two or more gismu;
  this convention helps the learner understand each tanru in its
  context. Creative interpretations are also possible, however:</p>

  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>  bajra cutci
    runner shoe
</pre>

  most probably refers to shoes suitable for runners, but might be
  interpreted in some imaginative instances as “shoes that run (by
  themselves?)”. In general, however, the meaning of a tanru is
  determined by the literal meaning of its components, and not by
  any connotations or figurative meanings. Thus 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>  sutra tavla
    fast-talker
</pre>

  would not necessarily imply any trickery or deception, unlike the
  English idiom, and a 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>  jikca toldi
    social butterfly
</pre>

  must always be an insect with large brightly-colored wings, of
  the family 
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>

  . 
  <p>The place structure of a tanru is always that of the final
  component of the tanru. Thus, the following has the place
  structure of “klama”:</p>

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">9.8)</a>  mi [cu] sutra klama la meris.
    --      =========== ---------
    I quickly-go to Mary.
</pre>

  With the conversion “se klama” as the final component of the
  tanru, the place structure of the entire selbri is that of “se
  klama”: the x1 place is the destination, and the x2 place is the
  one who goes: 
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">9.9)</a>  mi [cu] sutra se klama la meris.
    --      ============== ---------
    I quickly am-gone-to by Mary.
</pre>

  The following example shows that there is more to conversion than
  merely switching places, though: 
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">9.10)</a>    la tam. [cu] melbi tavla la
meris.
    -------      =========== ---------
    Tom beautifully-talks to Mary.
    Tom is a beautiful-talker to Mary.
</pre>

  has the place structure of “tavla”, but note the two distinct
  interpretations. 
  <p>Now, using conversion, we can modify the place structure
  order:</p>

<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">9.11)</a>    la meris. [cu] melbi se tavla
la tam.
    ---------      ============== -------
    Mary is beautifully-talked-to by Tom.
    Mary is a beautiful-audience for Tom.
</pre>

  and we see that the modification has been changed so as to focus
  on Mary’s role in the bridi relationship, leading to a different
  set of possible interpretations. 
  <p>Note that there is no place structure change if the modifying
  term is converted, and so less drastic variation in possible
  meanings:</p>

<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">9.12)</a>    la tam. [cu] tavla melbi la
meris.
    -------      =========== ---------
    Tom is talkerly-beautiful to Mary.

<a id="13" name="13">9.13)</a> la tam. [cu] se tavla melbi la
meris.
    -------      ============== ---------
    Tom is audiencely-beautiful to Mary.
</pre>

  and we see that the manner in which Tom is seen as beautiful by
  Mary changes, but Tom is still the one perceived as beautiful,
  and Mary, the observer of beauty.
