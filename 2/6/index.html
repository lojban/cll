        <h3>6. Variant bridi structure</h3>

  <p>Consider the sentence

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">6.1)</a>   mi       [cu] vecnu  ti             ta       zo'e
       --            =====  --             --       &mdash;-
       seller-x1     sells  goods-sold-x2  buyer-x3 price-x4
       I             sell   this           to that  for some price.
       I sell this-thing/these-things to that-buyer/those-buyers.
       (The price is obvious or unimportant.)
</pre>

  <a href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a>
  has one sumti (the x1) before the selbri. It is also possible to
  put more than one sumti before the selbri, without changing the
  order of sumti:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">6.2)</a>   mi        ti           [cu] vecnu ta
       --        --                ===== --
       seller-x1 goods-sold-x2     sells buyer-x3
       I         this              sell  to that.
       (translates as stilted or poetic English)
       I this thing do sell to that buyer.

<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>   mi        ti            ta      [cu] vecnu
       --        --            --           =====
       seller-x1 goods-sold-x2 buyer-x3     sells
       I         this          to-that      sell.
       (translates as stilted or poetic English)
       I this thing to that buyer do sell.
</pre>

  <a href="../6/#1">Examples 6.1</a> through <a href="../6/#3">6.3</a>
  mean the same thing. Usually, placing more than one sumti before
  the selbri is done for style or for emphasis on the sumti that
  are out-of-place from their normal position. (Native speakers of
  languages other than English may prefer such orders.)</p>

  <p>If there are no sumti before the selbri, then it is understood
  that the x1 sumti value is equivalent to “zo'e”; i.e.
  unimportant or obvious, and therefore not given. Any sumti after
  the selbri start counting from x2.

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">6.4)</a>   ta            [cu] melbi
       --                 =====
       object/idea-x1     is-beautiful (to someone by some standard)
       That/Those         is/are beautiful.
       That is beautiful.
       Those are beautiful.
</pre>

  when the x1 is omitted, becomes:

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">6.5)</a>                  melbi
       &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;--    =====
       unspecified-x1 is-beautiful (to someone by some standard)
       Beautiful!
       It’s beautiful!
</pre>
</p>

  <p>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which
  has become first in the sentence. This kind of sentence is termed
  an observative, because it is often used when someone first
  observes or takes note of the relationship, and wishes to quickly
  communicate it to someone else. Commonly understood English
  observatives include “Smoke!” upon seeing smoke or smelling the
  odor, or “Car!” to a person crossing the street who might be in
  danger. Any Lojban selbri can be used as an observative if no
  sumti appear before the selbri.</p>

  <p>The word “cu” does not occur in an observative; “cu” is a
  separator, and there must be a sumti before the selbri that needs
  to be kept separate for “cu” to be used. With no sumti
  preceding the selbri, “cu” is not permitted. Short words like
  “cu” which serve grammatical functions are called “cmavo” in
  Lojban.</p>
