        <h3>16. Indicators</h3>

  <p>Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a
  variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included
  in written language. Some of these are available in some
  languages as interjections (i.e. Aha!, Oh no!, Ouch!, Aahh!,
  etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.</p>

  <p>Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal
  indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on
  spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require
  no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very
  simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi
  apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply
  to the word immediately to the left. For example:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">16.1)</a>  .ie mi [cu] klama
           --      =====
       Agreement! I go.
       Yep! I’ll go.

<a id="2" name="2">16.2)</a>  .ei mi [cu] klama
           --      =====
    Obligation! I go.
    I should go.

<a id="3" name="3">16.3)</a>  mi [cu] klama le melbi .ui [ku]
       --      ===== ----------------
       I go to the beautiful-thing (and I am happy because it is the beautiful
           thing I’m going to).
</pre>
</p>

  <p>Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group
  of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal
  indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary
  about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear
  separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from
  the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison,
  the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively
  indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically
  equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content.
  The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not
  even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means
  “and”. 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">16.4)</a>  mi [cu] klama .i do [cu] stali
       --      =====    --      =====
       I go.  You stay.

<a id="5" name="5">16.5)</a>  mi [cu] klama .i ji'a do [cu] stali
       --      =====         --      =====
    I go.  In addition, you stay.  (added weight)

<a id="6" name="6">16.6)</a>  mi [cu] klama .i ku'i do [cu] stali
       --      =====         --      =====
    I go.  However, you stay.  (contrast)
</pre>

  Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”.
  Evidentials show the speaker’s relationship to the statement,
  specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These
  include “za'a” (I directly observe the relationship), “pe'i”
  (I believe that the relationship holds), “ru'a” (I postulate
  the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use
  this kind of words. 

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">16.7)</a>  pe'i do [cu] melbi
            --      =====
       I opine!  You are beautiful.

<a id="8" name="8">16.8)</a>  za'a do [cu] melbi
            --      =====
       I directly observe!  You are beautiful.
</pre>
