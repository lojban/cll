        <h3>2. Pronunciation</h3>

  <p>Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in 
  <a href="../../3/1/">Chapter 3</a>

  , but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray
  while digesting this chapter.</p>

  <p>Lojban has six recognized vowels: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”,
  “u” and “y”. The first five are roughly pronounced as “a”
  as in “father”, “e” as in “let”, “i” as in “machine”,
  “o” as in “dome” and “u” as in “flute”. “y” is
  pronounced as the sound called “schwa”, that is, as the
  unstressed “a” as in “about” or “around”.</p>

  <p>Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as
  their counterparts are in English: “b”, “d”, “f”, “k”,
  “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “t”, “v” and “z”. The
  letter “c”, on the other hand is pronounced as the “sh” in
  “hush”, while “j” is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the
  “s” in “pleasure”. “g” is always pronounced as it is in
  “gift”, never as in “giant”. “s” is as in “sell”, never
  as in “rose”. The sound of “x” is not found in English in
  normal words. It is found as “ch” in Scottish “loch”, as
  “j” in Spanish “junta”, and as “ch” in German “Bach”; it
  also appears in the English interjection “yecchh!”. It gets
  easier to say as you practice it. The letter “r” can be
  trilled, but doesn't have to be.</p>

  <p>The Lojban diphthongs “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, and “au” are
  pronounced much as in the English words “sigh”, “say”,
  “boy”, and “how”. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an “i”
  pronounced like English “y” (for example, “io” is pronounced
  “yo”) or else with a “u” pronounced like English “w” (for
  example, “ua” is pronounced “wa”).</p>

  <p>Lojban also has three “semi-letters”: the period, the comma
  and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a
  pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech
  stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter “h”.
  Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or
  end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is
  only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated
  with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily
  run together. It is not used in this chapter.</p>

  <p>Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words,
  unless that vowel is “y”, which is never stressed; in such
  words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has
  one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</p>

  <p>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are
  no silent letters.</p>
