        <h3>17. Tenses</h3>

  <p>In English, every verb is tagged for the grammatical category
  called tense: past, present, or future. The sentence

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">17.1)</a>  John went to the store
</pre>

  necessarily happens at some time in the past, whereas 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">17.2)</a>  John is going to the store
</pre>

  is necessarily happening right now.</p>

  <p>The Lojban sentence

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">17.3)</a>  la djan.  [cu] klama         le zarci
       --------  ==========         --------
       John      goes/went/will     go to-the store
</pre>

  serves as a translation of either <a href="../17/#1">Example 17.1</a> 
  or <a href="../17/#2">Example 17.2</a>, and of many other possible
  English sentences as well. It is not
  marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the
  present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no
  way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of 
  <a href="../17/#1">Example 17.1</a> would be: 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">17.4)</a>  la djan.   pu klama    le zarci
       --------   ========    --------
       John       [past] goes to-the store
</pre>

  where the tag “pu” forces the sentence to refer to a time in
  the past. Similarly, 

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">17.5)</a>  la djan.   ca klama       le zarci
       --------   ========       --------
       John       [present] goes to-the store
</pre>

  necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag “ca”.
  Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the
  selbri, just after the “cu”, and they may make a “cu”
  unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru.
  Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs.
  In Lojban, tense information is completely optional.
  If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.</p>

  <p>Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only
  to time but to space. The following example uses the tag “vu”
  to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the
  speaker:

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">17.6)</a>  do  vu vecnu    zo'e
       --  ========
       You yonder sell something-unspecified.
</pre>
</p>

  <p>In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be
  prefixed to the selbri of a description, producing a tensed
  sumti:

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">17.7)</a>  le pu bajra [ku] cu            tavla
       ----------------               =====
       The earlier/former/past runner talked/talks.
</pre>

  (Since Lojban tense is optional, we don’t know when he or she
  talks.)</p>

  <p>Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English
  use of “this” or “that” as adjectives, as in the following
  example, which uses the tag “vi” meaning “nearby”:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">17.8)</a>  le vi bajra [ku]   cu tavla
       ----------------      =====
       The nearby runner     talks.
       This runner talks.
</pre>

  Do not confuse the use of “vi” in <a href="../17/#8">Example 17.8</a> 
  with the cmavo “ti”, which also means “this”, but in the
  sense of “this thing”.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and
  within a description, as in the following example (where “ba”
  is the tag for future time):

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">17.9)</a>  le vi bajra [ku] cu ba klama
       ----------------    ========
       The here runner     [future] goes.
       The runner who is here will go.
       This runner will go.
</pre>
</p>
