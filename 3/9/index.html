          <h3>9. Syllabication And Stress</h3>

    <p>A Lojban word has one syllable for each of its vowels,
    diphthongs, and syllabic consonants (referred to simply as
    “vowels” for the purposes of this section.) Syllabication
    rules determine which of the consonants separating two vowels
    belong to the preceding vowel and which to the following vowel.
    These rules are conventional only; the phonetic facts of the
    matter about how utterances are syllabified in any language are
    always very complex.</p>

    <p>A single consonant always belongs to the following vowel. A
    consonant pair is normally divided between the two vowels;
    however, if the pair constitute a valid initial consonant pair,
    they are normally both assigned to the following vowel. A
    consonant triple is divided between the first and second
    consonants. Apostrophes and commas, of course, also represent
    syllable breaks. Syllabic consonants usually appear alone in
    their syllables.</p>

    <p>It is permissible to vary from these rules in Lojbanized
    names. For example, there are no definitive rules for the
    syllabication of names with consonant clusters longer than
    three consonants. The comma is used to indicate variant
    syllabication or to explicitly mark normal syllabication.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of Lojban syllabication:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  pujenaicajeba
    pu,je,nai,ca,je,ba
</pre>

    This word has no consonant pairs and is therefore
    syllabified before each medial consonant.

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  ninmu
    nin,mu
</pre>

    This word is split at a consonant pair.

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  fitpri
    fit,pri
</pre>

    This word is split at a consonant triple, between the first
    two consonants of the triple.

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>  sairgoi
    sair,goi
    sai,r,goi
</pre>

    This word contains the consonant pair “rg”; the “r” may
    be pronounced syllabically or not.

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>  klezba
    klez,ba
    kle,zba
</pre>

    This word contains the permissible initial pair “zb”, and
    so may be syllabicated either between “z” and “b” or before
    “zb”.</p>

    <p>Stress is a relatively louder pronunciation of one syllable
    in a word or group of words. Since every syllable has a vowel
    sound (or diphthong or syllabic consonant) as its nucleus, and
    the stress is on the vowel sound itself, the terms “stressed
    syllable” and “stressed vowel” are largely interchangeable
    concepts.</p>

    <p>Most Lojban words are stressed on the next-to-the-last, or
    penultimate, syllable. In counting syllables, however,
    syllables whose vowel is “y” or which contain a syllabic
    consonant (“l”, “m”, “n”, or “r”) are never counted.
    (The Lojban term for penultimate stress is “da'amoi
    terbasna”.) Similarly, syllables created solely by adding a
    buffer vowel, such as <span class="c3">[ɪ]</span>, are not
    counted.</p>

    <p>There are actually three levels of stress &mdash; primary,
    secondary, and weak. Weak stress is the lowest level, so it
    really means no stress at all. Weak stress is required for
    syllables containing “y”, a syllabic consonant, or a buffer
    vowel.</p>

    <p>Primary stress is required on the penultimate syllable of
    Lojban content words (called “brivla”). Lojbanized names may
    be stressed on any syllable, but if a syllable other than the
    penultimate is stressed, the syllable (or at least its vowel)
    must be capitalized in writing. Lojban structural words (called
    “cmavo”) may be stressed on any syllable or none at all.
    However, primary stress may not be used in a syllable just
    preceding a brivla, unless a pause divides them; otherwise, the
    two words may run together.</p>

    <p>Secondary stress is the optional and non-distinctive
    emphasis used for other syllables besides those required to
    have either weak or primary stress. There are few rules
    governing secondary stress, which typically will follow a
    speaker’s native language habits or preferences. Secondary
    stress can be used for contrast, or for emphasis of a point.
    Secondary stress can be emphasized at any level up to primary
    stress, although the speaker must not allow a false primary
    stress in brivla, since errors in word resolution could
    result.</p>

    <p>The following are Lojban words with stress explicitly
    shown:

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>  dikyjvo
    DI,ky,jvo
</pre>

    (In a fully-buffered dialect, the pronunciation would be: <span
    class="c3">['di kə jɪ vo]</span>.) Note that the
    syllable “ky” is not counted in determining stress. The vowel
    “y” is never stressed in a normal Lojban context. 

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>  .armstrong.
    .ARM,strong.
</pre>

    This is a Lojbanized version of the name “Armstrong”. The
    final “g” must be explicitly pronounced. With full buffering,
    the name would be pronounced:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">9.8)</a>  <span
class="c3">[ˈʔa rɪ mɪ sɪ tɪ ro nɪ gɪʔ]</span>
</pre>

    However, there is no need to insert a buffer in every
    possible place just because it is inserted in one place:
    partial buffering is also acceptable. In every case, however,
    the stress remains in the same place: on the first
    syllable.</p>

    <p>The English pronunciation of “Armstrong”, as spelled in
    English, is not correct by Lojban standards; the letters “ng”
    in English represent a velar nasal (IPA <span
    class="c3">[ŋ]</span>) which is a single consonant. In Lojban,
    “ng” represents two separate consonants that must both be
    pronounced; you may not use <span class="c3">[ŋ]</span> to
    pronounce Lojban “ng”, although <span class="c3">[ŋg]</span>
    is acceptable. English speakers are likely to have to pronounce
    the ending with a buffer, as one of the following:

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">9.9)</a>  <span class="c3">[ˈʔarm stron gɪʔ]</span>
    or <span class="c3">[ˈʔarm stroŋ gɪʔ]</span>
    or even <span class="c3">[ˈʔarm stro nɪgʔ]</span>
</pre>

    The normal English pronunciation of the name “Armstrong”
    could be Lojbanized as:

<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">9.10)</a>    .ARMstron.
</pre>

    since Lojban “n” is allowed to be pronounced as the velar
    nasal <span class="c3">[ŋ]</span>.</p>

    <p>Here is another example showing the use of “y”:

<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">9.11)</a>    bisydja
    BI,sy,dja
    BI,syd,ja
</pre>

    This word is a compound word, or lujvo, built from the two
    affixes “bis” and “dja”. When they are joined, an
    impermissible consonant pair results: “sd”. In accordance
    with the algorithm for making lujvo, explained in <a
    href="../../4/1/">Chapter 4</a>, a “y” is inserted to
    separate the impermissible consonant pair; the “y” is not
    counted as a syllable for purposes of stress determination.</p>

<p>
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">9.12)</a>    da'udja
    da'UD,ja
    da'U,dja
</pre>

    These two syllabications sound the same to a Lojban listener
    &mdash; the association of unbuffered consonants in syllables is of
    no import in recognizing the word.</p>

<p>
<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">9.13)</a>    e'u bridi
    e'u BRI,di
    E'u BRI,di
    e'U.BRI,di
</pre>

    In <a href="../9/#13">Example 9.13</a>, “e'u” is a cmavo and
    “bridi” is a brivla. Either of the first two pronunciations
    is permitted: no primary stress on either syllable of “e'u”,
    or primary stress on the first syllable. The third
    pronunciation, which places primary stress on the second
    syllable of the cmavo, requires that &mdash; since the following
    word is a brivla &mdash; the two words must be separated by a
    pause. Consider the following two cases:

<pre>
<a id="14" name="14">9.14)</a>    le re nobli prenu
    le re NObli PREnu

<a id="15" name="15">9.15)</a> le re no bliprenu
    le re no bliPREnu
</pre>

    If the cmavo “no” in <a href="../9/#15">Example 9.15</a>
    were to be stressed, the phrase would sound exactly like the
    given pronunciation of <a href="../9/#14">Example 9.14</a>, which
    is unacceptable in Lojban: a single pronunciation cannot
    represent both.</p>
