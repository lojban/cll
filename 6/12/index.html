          <h3><a id="12" name="12">12. Lojban names</h3>

    <p>Names have been used freely as sumti throughout this chapter
    without too much explanation. The time for the explanation has
    now come.</p>

    <p>First of all, there are two different kinds of things
    usually called ``names'' when talking about Lojban. The naming
    predicates of <a href=../2/>Section 2</a> are just ordinary
    predicates which are being used in a special sense. In
    addition, though, there is a class of Lojban words which are
    used only to name things: these can be recognized by the fact
    that they end in a consonant followed by a pause. Some
    examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-1" name="12-1">12.1)</a>    djan. meris. djein. .alis.
    John.  Mary.  Jane.  Alice.
</pre>
    (Note that ``.alis.'' begins as well as ends with a pause,
    because all Lojban words beginning with a vowel must be
    preceded by a pause. See <a href="../../4/1/">Chapter 4</a> for
    more information.) 

    <p>Names of this kind have two basic uses in Lojban: when used
    in a vocative phrase (see <a href=../11/>Section 11</a>) they
    indicate who the listener is or should be. When used with a
    descriptor of selma'o LA, namely ``la'', ``lai'', or ``la'i'',
    they form sumti which refer to the persons or things known by
    the name.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-2" name="12-2">12.2)</a>    la djonz. klama le zarci
    Jones goes to-the store.
    The Joneses go to-the store.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="12-3" name="12-3">12.3)</a>    lai djonz. klama le zarci
    The-mass-of Joneses go to-the store.
    The Joneses go to the store.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#12-2">Example 12.2</a>, the significance is
    that all the persons (perhaps only one) I mean to refer to by
    the name ``djonz.'' are going to the store. In <a
    href="#12-3">Example 12.3</a>, the Joneses are massified, and
    only some part of them needs to be going. Of course, by
    ``djonz.'' I can mean whomever I want: that person need not use
    the name ``djonz.'' at all.</p>

    <p>The sumti in <a href="#12-2">Example 12.2</a> and <a
    href="#12-3">Example 12.3</a> operate exactly like the similar
    uses of ``la'' and ``lai'' in <a href="#2-5">Examples
    2.5</a> and <a href="#3-6">3.6</a> respectively. The only
    difference is that these descriptors are followed by Lojban
    name-words. And in fact, the only difference between
    descriptors of selma'o LA (these three) and of selma'o LE (all
    the other descriptors) is that the former can be followed by
    name-words, whereas the latter cannot.</p>

    <p>There are certain limitations on the form of name-words in
    Lojban. In particular, they cannot contain the letter-sequences
    (or sound-sequences) ``la'', ``lai'', or ``doi'' unless a
    consonant immediately precedes within the name. Reciprocally,
    every name not preceded by ``la'', ``lai'', ``la'i'', or
    ``doi'' must be preceded by a pause instead:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-4" name="12-4">12.4)</a>    coi .djan.
    Hello, John.

<a id="12-5" name="12-5">12.5)</a> zo .djan. cmene mi
    The-word ``John'' is-the-name-of me.
    My name is John.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#12-4">Example 12.4</a> and <a
    href="#12-5">Example 12.5</a>, ``.djan.'' appears with a pause
    before it as well as after it, because the preceding word is
    not one of the four special cases. These rules force names to
    always be separable from the general word-stream.</p>

    <p>Unless some other rule prevents it (such as the rule that
    ``zo'' is always followed by a single word, which is quoted),
    multiple names may appear wherever one name is permitted, each
    with its terminating pause:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-6" name="12-6">12.6)</a>    doi djan. pol. djonz.
        le bloti cu klama fi la niuport. niuz.
    John Paul Jones,
        the boat comes (to somewhere) from Newport News.
</pre>
    A name may not contain any consonant combination that is
    illegal in Lojban words generally: the ``impermissible
    consonant clusters'' of Lojban morphology (explained in <a
    href="../../3/1/">Chapter 3</a>). Thus ``djeimz.'' is not a
    valid version of ``James'' (because ``mz'' is invalid):
    ``djeimyz'' will suffice. Similarly, ``la'' may be replaced by
    ``ly'', ``lai'' by ``ly'i'', ``doi'' by ``do'i'' or ``dai''.
    Here are a few examples: 
<pre>
   English name        invalid Lojban name valid Lojban names
</pre>
<pre>
   Doyle           *doi,l          do'il or dai,l
    Lyra            *lairas         ly'iras
    Lottie (American pron.) *latis          LYtis. or lotis.
</pre>
    Names may be borrowed from other languages or created
    arbitrarily. Another common practice is to use one or more
    rafsi, arranged to end with a consonant, to form a name: thus
    the rafsi ``loj-'' for ``logji'' (logical) and ``ban-'' for
    ``bangu'' (language) unite to form the name of this language: 
<pre>
<a id="12-7" name="12-7">12.7)</a>    lojban.
    Lojban
</pre>
    When borrowing names from another language which end in a
    vowel, or when turning a Lojban brivla (all of which end in
    vowels) into a name, the vowel may be removed or an arbitrary
    consonant added. It is common (but not required) to use the
    consonants ``s'' or ``n'' when borrowing vowel-final names from
    English; speakers of other languages may wish to use other
    consonant endings. 

    <p>The implicit quantifier for name sumti of the form ``la''
    followed by a name is ``su'o'', just as for ``la'' followed by
    a selbri.</p>
