          <h3>4. Masses and sets</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
    le'i    LE  the set described as
    lo'i    LE  the set of those which really are
    la'i    LA  the set of those named
</pre>
    Having said so much about masses, let us turn to sets. Sets are
    easier to understand than masses, but are more rarely used.
    Like a mass, a set is an abstract object formed from a number
    of individuals; however, the properties of a set are not
    derived from any of the properties of the individuals that
    compose it.

    <p>Sets have properties like cardinality (how many elements in
    the set), membership (the relationship between a set and its
    elements), and set inclusion (the relationship between two
    sets, one of which --- the superset -- contains all the
    elements of the other --- the subset). The set descriptors
    ``le'i'', ``lo'i'' and ``la'i'' correspond exactly to the mass
    descriptors ``lei'', ``loi'', and ``lai'' except that normally
    we talk of the whole of a set, not just part of it. Here are
    some examples contrasting ``lo'', ``loi'', and ``lo'i'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  lo ratcu cu bunre
    one-or-more-of-those-which-really-are rats are-brown.
    Some rats are brown.

<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>   loi ratcu cu cmalu
    part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really-are rats are-small.
    Rats are small.

<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>   lo'i ratcu cu barda
    The-set-of rats is-large.
    There are a lot of rats.
</pre>

    <p>The mass of rats is small because at least one rat is small;
    the mass of rats is also large; the set of rats, though, is
    unquestionably large -- it has billions of members. The mass of
    rats is also brown, since some of its components are; but it
    would be incorrect to call the set of rats brown --- brown-ness
    is not the sort of property that sets possess.</p>

    <p>Lojban speakers should generally think twice before
    employing the set descriptors. However, certain predicates have
    places that require set sumti to fill them. For example, the
    place structure of ``fadni'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is ordinary/common/typical/usual in property x2 among
      the members of set x3</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Why is it necessary for the x3 place of ``fadni'' to be a
    set? Because it makes no sense for an individual to be typical
    of another individual: an individual is typical of a group. In
    order to make sure that the bridi containing ``fadni'' is about
    an entire group, its x3 place must be filled with a set:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  mi fadni fi lo'i lobypli
    I am-ordinary among the-set-of Lojban-users.
    I am a typical Lojban user.
</pre>

    <p>Note that the x2 place has been omitted; I am not specifying
    in exactly which way I am typical --- whether in language
    knowledge, or age, or interests, or something else. If ``lo'i''
    were changed to ``lo'' in <a href="../4/#4">Example 4.4</a>, the
    meaning would be something like ``I am typical of some Lojban
    user'', which is nonsense.</p>
