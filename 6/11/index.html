          <h3><a id="11" name="11">11. The syntax of vocative phrases</h3>

    <p>Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this
    chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti.
    Grammatically, a vocative phrase is one of the so-called ``free
    modifiers'' of Lojban, along with subscripts, parentheses, and
    various other constructs explained in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>. They can be placed after
    many, but not all, constructions of the grammar: in general,
    after any elidable terminator (which, however, must not then be
    elided!), at the beginnings and ends of sentences, and in many
    other places.</p>

    <p>The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who the
    person being addressed is, or to indicate to that person that
    he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase begins with
    a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in
    more detail in <a href="../../13/1/">Chapter 13</a>. Sometimes
    that is all there is to the phrase:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">11.1)</a>    coi
    [greetings]
    Hello.

<a id="2" name="2">11.2)</a> je'e
    [acknowledgement]
    Uh-huh.
    Roger!
</pre>
    In these cases, the person being addressed is obvious from the
    context. However, a vocative word (more precisely, one or more
    cmavo of COI, possibly followed by ``doi'', or else just
    ``doi'' by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of
    phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee.
    The most common case is a name: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-2.5" name="11-2.5">11.2.5)</a>    coi. djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>

    <p>A pause is required (for morphological reasons) between a
    member of COI and a name. You can use ``doi'' instead of a
    pause:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">11.3)</a>    coi doi djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>
    means exactly the same thing and does not require a pause.
    Using ``doi'' by itself is like just saying someone's name to
    attract his or her attention: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">11.4)</a>    doi djan.
    John!
</pre>
    In place of a name, a description may appear, lacking its
    descriptor, which is understood to be ``le'': 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">11.5)</a>    coi xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, (red-type-of dress)-type-of girl.
    Hello, girl with the red dress!
</pre>
    The listener need not really be a ``xunre pastu nixli'', as
    long as she understands herself correctly from the description.
    (Actually, only a bare selbri can appear; explicit quantifiers
    are forbidden in this form of vocative, so the implicit
    quantifiers ``su'o le ro'' are in effect.) 

    <p>Finally, a complete sumti may be used, the most general
    case.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">11.6)</a>    co'o la bab. .e la noras.
    Goodbye, Bob and Nora.
</pre>
    <a href="../11/#5">Example 11.5</a> is thus the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">11.7)</a>    coi le xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, the-one-described-as red-dress girl!
</pre>
    and <a href="../11/#4">Example 11.4</a> is the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">11.8)</a>    doi la djan.
    The-one-named John!
</pre>
    Finally, the elidable terminator for vocative phrases is
    ``do'u'' (of selma'o DOhU), which is rarely needed except when
    a simple vocative word is being placed somewhere within a
    bridi. It may also be required when a vocative is placed
    between a sumti and its relative clause, or when there are a
    sequence of so-called ``free modifiers'' (vocatives,
    subscripts, utterance ordinals --- see <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a> --- metalinguistic comments
    --- see <a href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a> --- or reciprocals
    --- see <a href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>) which must be
    properly separated. 

    <p>The meaning of a vocative phrase that is within a sentence
    is not affected by its position in the sentence: thus <a
    href="../11/#9">Example 11.9</a> and <a href="../11/#10">Example
    11.10</a> mean the same thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">11.9)</a>    doi djan. ko klama mi
    John, come to me!

<a id="10" name="10">11.10)</a>   ko klama mi doi djan.
    Come to me, John!
</pre>

    <p>As usual for this chapter, the full syntax of vocative
    phrases has not been explained: relative clauses, discussed in
    <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>, make for more
    possibilities.</p>
