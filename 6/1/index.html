<h2>Chapter 6<br />
      To Speak Of Many Things: The Lojban sumti</h2>
          <h3>1. The five kinds of simple sumti</h3>

    <p>If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a
    sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that
    fills the places of simple Lojban sentences like:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
     I go-to the market
</pre>

    In <a href="../1/#1">Example 1.1</a>, “mi” and “le zarci” are
    the sumti. It is easy to see that these two sumti are not of
    the same kind: “mi” is a pro-sumti (the Lojban analogue of a
    pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas “le zarci” is a
    description which refers to something described as being a
    market.</p> 

    <p>There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>
      <dd>descriptions like “le zarci”, which usually begin with
      a descriptor (called a “gadri” in Lojban) such as “le”;</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>
      <dd>pro-sumti, such as “mi”;</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>
      <dd>names, such as “la lojban.”, which usually begin with “la”;</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>
      <dd>quotations, which begin with “lu”, “le'u”, “zo”, or “zoi”;</dd>

      <dt>5)</dt>
      <dd>pure numbers, which usually begin with “li”.</dd>
    </dl>
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few examples of each kind of sumti:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">1.2)</a>  e'osai ko sarji la lojban.
     Please support Lojban!
</pre>

    <a href="../1/#2">Example 1.2</a> exhibits “ko”, a pro-sumti;
    and “la lojban.”, a name. 

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">1.3)</a>  mi cusku lu e'osai li'u le tcidu
     I express “Please!” to-the reader.
</pre>

    <a href="../1/#3">Example 1.3</a> exhibits “mi”, a pro-sumti;
    “lu e'osai li'u”, a quotation; and “le tcidu”, a
    description. 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">1.4)</a>  ti mitre li ci
     This measures-in-meters the-number three.
     This is three meters long.
</pre>

    <a href="../1/#4">Example 1.4</a> exhibits “ti”, a pro-sumti;
    and “li ci”, a number.</p>

    <p>Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the
    most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given
    to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions.
    Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail
    in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>, <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>, and <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a> respectively, so this chapter
    only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See <a
    href=../13/>Section 13</a> through <a href=../15/>Section
    15</a> for these summaries.</p>
