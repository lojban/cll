          <h3>8. Indefinite descriptions</h3>

    <p>By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the
    descriptor “lo”, but never any other descriptor, from a
    description like that of <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a>;
    namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no
    explicit inner quantifier. The following example:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">8.1)</a>  ci gerku [ku] cu blabi
     Three dogs are white.
</pre>

    is equivalent in meaning to <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a>.
    Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable
    terminator “ku” may still be used. The name “indefinite
    description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of
    course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its
    counterpart with an explicit “lo”. Indefinite descriptions
    were introduced into the language in order to imitate the
    syntax of English and other natural languages.</p>

    <p>Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is
    no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer
    quantifier (thus “*gerku cu blabi” is ungrammatical), or
    which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus “*reboi ci gerku
    cu blabi” is also ungrammatical --- “re ci gerku cu blabi”
    is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).</p>

    <p>Note: <a href="../6/#3">Example 6.3</a> also contains an
    indefinite description, namely “su'o ci cutci”; another
    version of that example using an explicit “lo” would be:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">8.2)</a>  mi ponse su'o ci lo cutci
     I possess at-least three things-which-really-are shoes
     I own three (or more) shoes.
</pre>
</p>
