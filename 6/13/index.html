          <h3><a id="13" name="13">13. Pro-sumti summary</h3>

    <p>The Lojban pro-sumti are the cmavo of selma'o KOhA. They
    fall into several classes: personal, definable,
    quantificational, reflexive, back-counting, indefinite,
    demonstrative, metalinguistic, relative, question. More details
    are given in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>; this section
    mostly duplicates information found there, but adds material on
    the implicit quantifier of each pro-sumti.</p>

    <p>The following examples illustrate each of the classes.
    Unless otherwise noted below, the implicit quantification for
    pro-sumti is ``ro'' (all). In the case of pro-sumti which refer
    to other sumti, the ``ro'' signifies ``all of those referred to
    by the other sumti'': thus it is possible to restrict, but not
    to extend, the quantification of the other sumti.</p>

    <p>Personal pro-sumti (``mi'', ``do'', ``mi'o'', ``mi'a'',
    ``ma'a'', ``do'o'', ``ko'') refer to the speaker or the
    listener or both, with or without third parties:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">13.1)</a>    mi prami do
    I love you.
</pre>
    The personal pro-sumti may be interpreted in context as either
    representing individuals or masses, so the implicit quantifier
    may be ``pisu'o'' rather than ``ro'': in particular, ``mi'o'',
    ``mi'a'', ``ma'a'', and ``do'o'' specifically represent mass
    combinations of the individuals (you and I, I and others, you
    and I and others, you and others) that make them up. 

    <p>Definable pro-sumti (``ko'a'', ``ko'e'', ``ko'i'', ``ko'o'',
    ``ko'u'', ``fo'a'', ``fo'e'', ``fo'i'', ``fo'o'', ``fo'u'')
    refer to whatever the speaker has explicitly made them refer
    to. This reference is accomplished with ``goi'' (of selma'o
    GOI), which means ``defined-as''.</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">13.2)</a>    le cribe goi ko'a cu xekri
        .i ko'a citka le smacu
    The bear defined-as it-1 is-black.
        It-1 eats the mouse.
</pre>
    Quantificational pro-sumti (``da'', ``de'', ``di'') are used as
    variables in bridi involving predicate logic: 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">13.3)</a>    ro da poi prenu
        cu prami pa de poi finpe
    All somethings-1 which-are persons
        love one something-2 which-is a-fish.
    All persons love a fish (each his/her own).
</pre>
    (This is not the same as ``All persons love a certain fish'';
    the difference between the two is one of quantifier order.) The
    implicit quantification rules for quantificational pro-sumti
    are particular to them, and are discussed in detail in <a
    href="../../16/1/">Chapter 16</a>. Roughly speaking, the
    quantifier is ``su'o'' (at least one) when the pro-sumti is
    first used, and ``ro'' (all) thereafter. 

    <p>Reflexive pro-sumti (``vo'a'', ``vo'e'', ``vo'i'', ``vo'o'',
    ``vo'u'') refer to the same referents as sumti filling other
    places in the same bridi, with the effect that the same thing
    is referred to twice:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">13.4)</a>    le cribe cu batci vo'a
    The bear bites what-is-in-the-x1-place.
    The bear bites itself.
</pre>
    Back-counting pro-sumti (``ri'', ``ra'', ``ru'') refer to the
    referents of previous sumti counted backwards from the
    pro-sumti: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">13.5)</a>    mi klama la frankfurt. ri
    I go to-Frankfurt from-the-referent-of-the-last-sumti
    I go from Frankfurt to Frankfurt (by some unstated route).
</pre>
    Indefinite pro-sumti (``zo'e'', ``zu'i'', ``zi'o'') refer to
    something which is unspecified: 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">13.6)</a>    mi klama la frankfurt. zo'e zo'e zo'e
    I go to-Frankfurt from-unspecified via-unspecified
        by-means-unspecified.
</pre>
    The implicit quantifier for indefinite pro-sumti is, well,
    indefinite. It might be ``ro'' (all) or ``su'o'' (at least one)
    or conceivably even ``no'' (none), though ``no'' would require
    a very odd context indeed. 

    <p>Demonstrative pro-sumti (``ti'', ``ta'', ``tu'') refer to
    things pointed at by the speaker, or when pointing is not
    possible, to things near or far from the speaker:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">13.7)</a>    ko muvgau ti ta tu
    you [imperative] move this-thing from-that-nearby-place
        to-that-further-away-place
    Move this from there to over there!
</pre>
    Metalinguistic pro-sumti (``di'u'', ``de'u'', ``da'u'',
    ``di'e'', ``de'e'', ``da'e'', ``dei'', ``do'i'') refer to
    spoken or written utterances, either preceding, following, or
    the same as the current utterance. 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">13.8)</a>    li re su'i re du li vo
        .i la'e di'u jetnu
    The-number two plus two equals the-number four.
        The-referent-of the-previous-utterance is-true.
</pre>
    The implicit quantifier for metalinguistic pro-sumti is
    ``su'o'' (at least one), because they are considered analogous
    to ``lo'' descriptions: they refer to things which really are
    previous, current, or following utterances. 

    <p>The relative pro-sumti (``ke'a'') is used within relative
    clauses (see <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a> for a
    discussion of relative clauses) to refer to whatever sumti the
    relative clause is attached to.</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">13.9)</a>    mi viska le mlatu ku
        poi zo'e zbasu ke'a
        loi slasi
    I see the cat(s)
        such-that something-unspecified makes it/them (the cats)
        from-a-mass-of plastic.
    I see the cat(s) made of plastic.
</pre>
    The question pro-sumti (``ma'') is used to ask questions which
    request the listener to supply a sumti which will make the
    question into a truth: 
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">13.10)</a>  do klama ma
    You go to-what-sumti?
    Where are you going?
</pre>
    The implicit quantifier for the question pro-sumti is ``su'o''
    (at least one), because the listener is only being asked to
    supply a single answer, not all correct answers. 

    <p>In addition, sequences of lerfu words (of selma'o BY and
    related selma'o) can also be used as definable pro-sumti.</p>
