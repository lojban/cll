    <p> <a id="idm47087038522800" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038898464" class="indexterm"></a> Lojban (pronounced 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">LOZH-bahn</span>”</span>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Loglan</span>”</span> by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article 
    
    
    “<span class="citetitle">Loglan</span>”, published in 
    <em class="citetitle">Scientific American</em>, June, 1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel 
    
    <em class="citetitle">The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</em>) and computer publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038518672" class="indexterm"></a> There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:</p>
    <div class="bullets"><ul class="bullets" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

    <p> <a id="idm47087038505648" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038504896" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038503888" class="indexterm"></a> This book is what is called a 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">reference grammar</span>”</span>. It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present. Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features. The word 
    
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">discover</span>”</span> is used advisedly; Lojban was not 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">invented</span>”</span> by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.</p>
    <p>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Formal Grammars">Chapter 21</a>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-tour.html" title="Chapter 2. A Quick Tour of Lojban Grammar, With Diagrams">Chapter 2</a> gives a brief overview of the language, 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Formal Grammars">Chapter 21</a> gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic flesh on those formal bones. I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become available.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038498768" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038498016" class="indexterm"></a> Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary – Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world, as 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-lujvo.html" title="Chapter 12. Dog House And White House: Determining lujvo Place Structures">Chapter 12</a> explains – and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?) native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language-meisters.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038495136" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038494128" class="indexterm"></a> It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas. Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038492416" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038491408" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038490656" class="indexterm"></a> Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-about.html" title="Chapter 1. Lojban As We Mangle It In Lojbanistan: About This Book">Chapter 1</a> (which you are now reading), for example, is an allusion to the book 
    <em class="citetitle">English As We Speak It In Ireland</em>, by P. W. Joyce, which is a sort of informal reference grammar of Hiberno-English. 
    
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Lojbanistan</span>”</span> is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language, and a term for the actual community of Lojban-speakers, scattered over the world. Why 
    
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mangle</span>”</span>? As yet, nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all well, by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan; that is one of the circumstances this book is meant to help remedy.</p>

    <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Formal Grammars">Chapter 21</a> is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038471952" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038470944" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038470192" class="indexterm"></a> It is useful to talk further about 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-about.html#example-random-id-hrtj" title="Example 1.1. ">Example 1.1</a> for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Lojban (in italics), the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the Lojban into English (in boldface), and the third in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the 
    
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">literal translation</span>”</span> and the 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">colloquial translation</span>”</span> respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038467376" class="indexterm"></a> Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In 
    
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-phonology.html" title="Chapter 3. The Hills Are Alive With The Sounds Of Lojban">Chapter 3</a>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>
    
    <p> <a id="idm47087038464960" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038463952" class="indexterm"></a> Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038462112" class="indexterm"></a> A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in 
    
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-tour.html" title="Chapter 2. A Quick Tour of Lojban Grammar, With Diagrams">Chapter 2</a>, except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters.</p>

    <p> <a id="idm47087038458992" class="indexterm"></a> It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</p>
    <p> <a id="idm47087038457600" class="indexterm"></a> When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published).

    <p>Nick Nicholas (NSN) would like to thank the following Lojbanists: Mark Shoulson, Veijo Vilva, Colin Fine, And Rosta, and Iain Alexander for their suggestions and comments; John Cowan, for his extensive comments, his exemplary trailblazing of Lojban grammar, and for solving the 
    <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">manskapi</em></span> dilemma for NSN; Jorge Llambias, for his even more extensive comments, and for forcing NSN to think more than he was inclined to; Bob LeChevalier, for his skeptical overview of the issue, his encouragement, and for scouring all Lojban text his computer has been burdened with for lujvo; Nora Tansky LeChevalier, for writing the program converting old rafsi text to new rafsi text, and sparing NSN from embarrassing errors; and Jim Carter, for his dogged persistence in analyzing lujvo algorithmically, which inspired this research, and for first identifying the three lujvo classes.</p>
    
    <p> <a id="idm47087038432720" class="indexterm"></a> Of course, the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James Cooke Brown as the language inventor, and also to several earlier contributors to the development of the language. Especially noteworthy are Doug Landauer, Jeff Prothero, Scott Layson, Jeff Taylor, and Bob McIvor. Final responsibility for the remaining errors and infelicities is solely mine.</p>

    <p> <a id="idm47087038429440" class="indexterm"></a>  <a id="idm47087038428688" class="indexterm"></a> The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is one of the products, is 
    <em class="citetitle">Loglan 1: A Logical Language</em> by James Cooke Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.). The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him.</p>
    
    <p>The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American philosopher W. v.O. Quine, especially 
    <em class="citetitle">Word and Object</em> (1960, M.I.T. Press). Much of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on observation sentences, reads like a literal translation from Lojban.</p>
    
    <p>The theory of negation expounded in 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter-negation.html" title="Chapter 15. “No” Problems: On Lojban Negation">Chapter 15</a> is derived from a reading of Laurence Horn's work 
    <em class="citetitle">A Natural History of Negation</em>.</p>
    <p>Of course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the uses or misuses I have made of their works.</p>
    
    <p> <a id="idm47087038423104" class="indexterm"></a> Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three other books about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English dictionary, and a book containing general information about Lojban. You can probably get these books, if they have been published, from the same place where you got this book. In addition, other books not yet foreseen may also exist.</p>
