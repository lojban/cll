    <para role="indent">Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> if it is nearby, or 
    <valsi>ta</valsi> if it is somewhat further away, or 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-anaphoric-cmavo"/>.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>reference</primary><secondary>ambiguity of ti/ta/tu</secondary></indexterm> However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</para>

    <para role="indent">What is the referent of 
    <valsi>ti</valsi>? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for

    <quote>relative clause</quote>. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator 
    <valsi>ku'o</valsi> (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, 
    <valsi>noi</valsi> is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo 
    <valsi>poi</valsi>, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.</para>

    <valsi>ke'a</valsi> (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the

    <valsi>poi</valsi>, and incidental (sometimes called simply 
    <quote>non-restrictive</quote>) relative clauses introduced by 
    <valsi>noi</valsi>. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in 
    <xref linkend="section-poi"/> are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)</para>

    </example>
    <para role="indent">In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLXK"/>, the information conveyed by 
    <jbophrase>poi blanu</jbophrase> is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> relative clauses are called restrictive. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLys"/>, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause 
    <jbophrase>noi blanu</jbophrase> just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</para>

These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by 
    
    
    <quote>that</quote> as well as 
    <quote>which</quote> and 
    <quote>who</quote>, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with 
    <quote>that</quote>. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> and 
    <valsi>noi</valsi> rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.</para>

    <para role="indent"> <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clause</primary><secondary>contrasted with tanru</secondary></indexterm> So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, 
    
    <jbophrase>blabi karce</jbophrase>, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of

  <section xml:id="section-descriptors">
    <title><anchor xml:id="c8s6"/>Relative clauses and descriptors</title>
    <para>So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.</para>
    <para>There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (<valsi>le</valsi>, 
    <valsi>lo</valsi>, or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>), and after the 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-pcvP"/>, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para role="indent">Here

    <para>When a simple descriptor using

    <para role="indent">
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-UmLX"/> will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; 
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ"/>, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in 
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ"/>, the elidable terminator 
      <valsi>ku'o</valsi> must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (<valsi>blabi</valsi>) will merge with the selbri of the description (<valsi>gerku</valsi>), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in

    <para>As is explained in detail in

When preposed relative clauses of the 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-1ng6"/> type were devised, possessive sumti were most easily viewed as a special case of them.</para>

    <valsi>pe</valsi>. Roughly speaking, the legal possessor sumti are: pro-sumti, quotations, names and descriptions, and numbers. In addition, the possessor sumti may not be preceded by a quantifier, as such a form would be interpreted as the unusual 
    <quote>descriptor + quantifier + sumti</quote> type of description. All these sumti forms are explained in full in

    <para role="indent">Note that 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMGj"/> says farewell to something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named 
    <quote>Horse</quote>. In a sense, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMGj"/> is ambiguous between 
    <jbophrase>co'o le xirma</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>co'o la xirma</jbophrase>, a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in general: saying 
    <quote>George</quote> doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.</para>

    <para role="indent">Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmgM"/>, as sentences by themselves.</para>

In vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative clauses must come just after the names:</para>
