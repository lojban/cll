    </example>
    <para role="indent">This nonsensical conversation results because the King insists on treating the word 
    <quote>nobody</quote> as a name, a name of somebody. However, the essential nature of the English word 
    <quote>nobody</quote> is that it doesn't refer to somebody; or to put the matter another way, there isn't anybody to which it refers.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>nobody</primary><secondary>ambiguous interpretations of</secondary></indexterm> The central point of contradiction in the dialogue arises in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-x9fC"/>, when the King says 
    <quote>... Nobody walks slower than you</quote>. This claim would be plausible if 
    <quote>Nobody</quote> were really a name, since the Messenger could only pass someone who does walk more slowly than he. But the Messenger interprets the word 
    <quote>nobody</quote> in the ordinary English way, and says (in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-105i"/>) 
    <quote>... nobody walks much faster than I do</quote> (i.e., I walk faster, or as fast as, almost everyone), which the King then again misunderstands. Both the King and the Messenger are correct according to their respective understandings of the ambiguous word 
    <quote>nobody/Nobody</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>nobody</primary><secondary>Lojban contrasted with English</secondary></indexterm> There are Lojban words or phrases corresponding to the problematic English words 
    <quote>somebody</quote>, 
    <quote>nobody</quote>, 
    <quote>anybody</quote>, 
    <quote>everybody</quote> (and their counterparts 
    <quote>some/no/any/everyone</quote> and 
    <quote>some/no/any/everything</quote>), but they obey rules which can often be surprising to English-speakers. The dialogue above simply cannot be translated into Lojban without distortion: the name 
    <quote>Nobody</quote> would have to be represented by a Lojban name, which would spoil the perfection of the wordplay. As a matter of fact, this is the desired result: a logical language should not allow two conversationalists to affirm 
    
    <quote>Nobody walks slower than the Messenger</quote> and 
    <quote>Nobody walks faster than the Messenger</quote> and both be telling the truth. (Unless, of course, nobody but the Messenger walks at all, or everyone walks at exactly the same speed.)</para>

There are no new grammatical constructs explained in this chapter; instead, it discusses the way in which existing facilities that allow Lojban-speakers to resolve problems like the above, using the concepts of modern logic. However, we will not approach the matter from the viewpoint of logicians, although readers who know something of logic will discover familiar notions in Lojban guise.</para>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>selbri variables</primary><secondary>prenex form as indefinite description</secondary></indexterm> The translations of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gEWB"/> show how unidiomatic selbri variables are in English; Lojban sentences like 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gEWB"/> need to be totally reworded in English. Furthermore, when a selbri variable appears in the prenex, it is necessary to precede it with a quantifier such as 
    <valsi>su'o</valsi>; it is ungrammatical to just say 
    <jbophrase>bu'a zo'u</jbophrase>. This rule is necessary because only sumti can appear in the prenex, and 
    <jbophrase>su'o bu'a</jbophrase> is technically a sumti &ndash; in fact, it is an indefinite description like 
    
    
    <jbophrase>re nanmu</jbophrase>, since 
    <valsi>bu'a</valsi> is grammatically equivalent to a brivla like 
    <valsi>nanmu</valsi>. However, indefinite descriptions involving the bu'a-series cannot be imported from the prenex.</para>

    <jbophrase>re da</jbophrase> appears later, it refers to two of those three things &ndash; there is no saying which ones. Further uses of 
    <valsi>da</valsi> alone, if there were any, would refer once more to the three cats, so the requantification of

    <valsi>.ije</valsi>. Prenexes that precede embedded bridi such as relative clauses and abstractions extend only to the end of the clause, as explained in

    <xref linkend="section-subscripts-general"/>, but in general consist of the cmavo

There are many more aspects of logic that I neither fully understand nor feel competent to explain, neither in abstract nor in their Lojban realization. Lojban was designed to be a language that makes predicate logic speakable, and achieving that goal completely will need to wait for someone who understands both logic and Lojban better than I do. I can only hope to have pointed out the areas that are well-understood (and by implication, those that are not).</para>
