    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>pronouns in English</primary><secondary>as noun abbreviations</secondary></indexterm> Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages, require mechanisms of abbreviation. If every time we referred to something, we had to express a complete description of it, life would be too short to say what we have to say. In English, we have words called 
    <quote>pronouns</quote> which allow us to replace nouns or noun phrases with shorter terms. An English with no pronouns might look something like this:</para>

    <quote>pro-sumti</quote>. A purely Lojban term would be 
    <jbophrase>sumti cmavo</jbophrase>: all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In exactly the same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to selma'o GOhA) which serve as selbri or full bridi. These may be called 
    <quote>pro-bridi</quote> or 
    <jbophrase>bridi cmavo</jbophrase>. This chapter explains the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall into a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o KOhA, we have among others the mi-series, the ko'a-series, the da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of pro-sumti is explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi, it is explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't have pro-bridi analogues, however.</para>

    <quote>referent</quote> means the thing to which a pro-sumti (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the speaker of a sentence is James, then the referent of the word 
    <quote>I</quote> is James. On the other hand, the term 
    <quote>antecedent</quote> refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi) implicitly repeats. In</para>

    <quote>that</quote> serve this function among others: 
    <quote>this</quote> refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and 
    <quote>that</quote> refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo

    <valsi>ta</valsi>, and

    <valsi>ta</valsi> refers to something that is near the listener, whereas 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> and

    <valsi>ta</valsi> and 
    <valsi>do</valsi>, that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone.

    <para role="indent">Note that

    <valsi>ri</valsi> appears. This prevents 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like 
    <jbophrase>la alis.</jbophrase> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-bs5R"/> is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.</para>
    <para>Certain sumti are ignored by

    <valsi>ra</valsi> and

    <valsi>ra</valsi> refer to the last sumti, like
