    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth functions</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical language</primary><secondary>truth functions</secondary></indexterm> Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means 
    
    <quote>logical language</quote>. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a 
    
    <quote>sentence</quote> (sometimes called a 
    <quote>statement</quote> or 
    <quote>proposition</quote>), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of 
    <quote>truth functions</quote>, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-mJ6y">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e1d1"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>man or woman</primary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>John is a man or James is a woman.</para>
    </example>
    <para role="noindent"> 


 is true if 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true, or if 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether 
    <quote>John is a man or James is a woman</quote> is true, provided we know the meaning of 
    <quote>or</quote>. Here 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> and 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> are the component sentences.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>negating a sentence</primary><secondary>and truth value</secondary></indexterm> We will use the phrase 
    <quote>negating a sentence</quote> to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing 
    
    <quote>It is false that ...</quote>, or more idiomatically by inserting 
    <quote>not</quote> at the right point, generally before the verb. 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote> is the negation of 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation 
    <quote>Not!</quote></para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary></indexterm> Words like 
    <quote>or</quote> are called 
    <quote>logical connectives</quote>, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as 
    
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>and/or</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>only if</quote>, 
    <quote>whether or not</quote>, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</para>
    <para>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth table</primary><secondary>explanation</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth functions</primary><secondary>16 possible</secondary></indexterm> There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for 
    
    <quote>or</quote>:</para>
    <informaltable>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td>first</td>
            <td>second</td>
            <td>result</td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
          <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
          </tr>
    </informaltable>
    <para>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of the result is also false.</para>
    <para>Suppose that 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true (and 
    <quote>John is not a man</quote> is false), and that 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is false (and 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote> is true). Then the truth table tells us that</para>

      <member><quote>John is not a man, or James is not a woman</quote>         (false, true )  is true</member>

    </simplelist>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>&quot;or&quot;</primary><secondary>&quot;and/or&quot; contrasted with &quot;either … or … but not both&quot;</secondary></indexterm> Note that the kind of 
    <quote>or</quote> used in this example can also be expressed (in formal English) with 
    <quote>and/or</quote>. There is a different truth table for the kind of 
    
    <quote>or</quote> that means 
    <quote>either ... or ... but not both</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth tables</primary><secondary>notation convention</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth tables</primary><secondary>abbreviated format</secondary></indexterm> To save space, we will write truth tables in a shorter format henceforth. Let the letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by reading down the third column of the table above. So TTTF is the abbreviated truth table for the 
    
    
    <quote>or</quote> truth function. Here are the 16 possible truth functions, with an English version of what it means to assert that each function is, in fact, true (<quote>first</quote> refers to the first sentence, and 
    <quote>second</quote> to the second sentence):<indexterm type="general"><primary>truth tables</primary><secondary>list of 16 in abbreviated form</secondary></indexterm></para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>rationale for multiple sets in grammar</secondary></indexterm> In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>Consider the English sentence:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-ptgf">

    </example>
    <para role="noindent"> 


 where the last word could be followed by 
    <quote>the door</quote>, a noun phrase, or by 
    <quote>saw the horses</quote>, a sentence with subject omitted, or by 
    <quote>John went to the door</quote>, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="lojban-word"><primary>JA selma'o</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>selma'o</secondary><tertiary>enumerated</tertiary></indexterm> Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>cmavo</secondary><tertiary>format for each selma'o</tertiary></indexterm> Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> is 
    <valsi>a</valsi>. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, which is a truth function, or 
    <valsi>a</valsi>, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> in selma'o GIhA is 
    <valsi>gi'e</valsi>, and the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> in selma'o GA is 
    <valsi>gu</valsi>. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>compound logical connectives</primary><secondary>components</secondary></indexterm> Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-connectives-introduction"/>. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo 
    <valsi>se</valsi>, 
    <valsi>na</valsi>, or 
    <valsi>nai</valsi>. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</para>

The name is derived by changing the final 
    <quote>-A</quote> of the selma'o name to 
    <quote>-ek</quote>; the reasons for using 
    <quote>-ek</quote> are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use 
    <quote>eks</quote> as the plural of 
    
    <quote>ek</quote>.) When the term 
    <quote>logical connective</quote> is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.</para>

    <valsi>i</valsi>, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences. The compound produced by 
    <valsi>i</valsi> followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.</para>

    <jbophrase>blanu zdani</jbophrase>, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of 
    <jbophrase>blanu bolci</jbophrase>, Lojbanists can say 
    <jbophrase>blanu je bolci</jbophrase>, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in

    <para>So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth questions</primary><secondary>simple</secondary></indexterm> The simplest kind of question is of the type 
    <quote>Is it true that ...</quote> where some statement follows. This type is called a

    <jbophrase>le nanmu joi</jbophrase> and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second 
    <valsi>le</valsi> cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.</para>

No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo 
    <valsi>pu</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ca</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>ba</valsi> (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a
