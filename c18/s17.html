    <h3><a id="s17" name="s17">17. Logical and non-logical connectives within mekso</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   .abu    BY  letter ``a''
    by  BY  letter ``b''
    cy  BY  letter ``c''
    fe'a    VUhU    nth root of (default square root)
    lo'o    LOhO    terminator for LI
</pre>
    As befits a logical language, Lojban has extensive provision
    for logical connectives within both operators and operands.
    Full details on logical and non-logical connectives are
    provided in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>. Operands are
    connected in afterthought with selma'o A and in forethought
    with selma'o GA, just like sumti. Operators are connected in
    afterthought with selma'o JA and in forethought with selma'o
    GUhA, just like tanru components. This parallelism is no
    accident. 

    <p>In addition, A+BO and A+KE constructs are allowed for
    grouping logically connected operands, and ``ke ... ke'e'' is
    allowed for grouping logically connected operators, although
    there are no analogues of tanru among the operators.</p>

    <p>Despite the large number of rules required to support this
    feature, it is of relatively minor importance in the mekso
    scheme of things. <a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> exhibits
    afterthought logical connection between operands:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d1"
name="e17d1">17.1)</a>    vei ci .a vo ve'o prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( three or four ) people go-to the market.
</pre>
    <a href="#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> is equivalent in meaning, but
    uses forethought connection: 
<pre>
<a id="e17d2"
name="e17d2">17.2)</a>    vei ga ci gi vo ve'o prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( either 3 or 4 ) people go-to the market.
</pre>
    Note that the mekso here are being used as quantifiers. Lojban
    requires that any mekso other than a simple number be enclosed
    in parentheses when used as a quantifier. This rule prevents
    ambiguities that do not exist when using ``li''. 

    <p>By the way, ``li'' has an elidable terminator, ``lo'o'',
    which is needed when a ``li'' sumti is followed by a logical
    connective that could seem to be within the mekso. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d3" name="e17d3">17.3)</a>    li re su'i re du
        li vo lo'o .onai lo nalseldjuno namcu
    the-number two plus two equals
        the-number four or else a non-known number.
</pre>

    <p>Omitting the ``lo'o'' would cause the parser to assume that
    another operand followed the ``.onai'' and reject ``lo'' as an
    invalid operand.</p>

    <p>Simple examples of logical connection between operators are
    hard to come by. A contrived example is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d4"
name="e17d4">17.4)</a>    li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo
    the-number two plus and times two equals the-number four.
    2 + 2 = 4 and 2 &times; 2 = 4.
</pre>

    <p>The forethought-connection form of <a href="#e17d4">Example
    17.4</a> is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d5" name="e17d5">17.5)</a>    li re ge su'i gi pi'i re
        du li vo
    the-number two both plus and times two
        equals the-number four.
    Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 &times; 2 = 4.
</pre>

    <p>Here is a classic example of operand logical connection:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d6"
name="e17d6">17.6)</a>    go li .abu bi'epi'i vei xy. te'a re ve'o
        su'i by. bi'epi'i xy. su'i cy.
        du li no
    gi li xy. du li vei va'a by. ku'e
        su'i ja vu'u fe'a
        vei by. bi'ete'a re vu'u
        vo bi'epi'i .abu bi'epi'i cy. ve'o [ku'e] ve'o
        fe'i re bi'epi'i .abu
    if-and-only-if the-number ``a''-times-( ``x'' power two )
        plus ``b''-times-``x'' plus ``c''
        equals the-number zero
    then the-number x equals the-number [ the-negation-of( b )
        plus or minus the-root-of
        ( ``b''-power-2 minus
        four-times-``a''-times-``c'' ) ]
        divided-by two-times-``a''.
    Iff ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c = 0,
        then x =-b &plusmn; <span class="c3">&Ouml;</span>
<!--sqrt-->(b<sup>2</sup>  - 4ac)
            -----------------------
                2a
</pre>
    Note the mixture of styles in <a href="#e17d6">Example
    17.6</a>: the negation of b and the square root are represented
    by forethought and most of the operator precedence by prefixed
    ``bi'e'', but explicit parentheses had to be added to group the
    numerator properly. In addition, the square root parentheses
    cannot be removed here in favor of simple ``fe'a'' and ``ku'e''
    bracketing, because infix operators are present in the operand.
    Getting <a href="#e17d6">Example 17.6</a> to parse perfectly
    using the current parser took several tries: a more relaxed
    style would dispense with most of the ``bi'e'' cmavo and just
    let the standard precedence rules be understood. 

    <p>Non-logical connection with JOI and BIhI is also permitted
    between operands and between operators. One use for this
    construct is to connect operands with ``bi'o'' to create
    intervals:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d7" name="e17d7">17.7)</a>    li no ga'o bi'o ke'i pa
    the-number zero (inclusive) from-to (exclusive) one
    [0,1)
    the numbers from zero to one, including zero
        but not including one
</pre>
    Intervals defined by a midpoint and range rather than beginning
    and end points can be expressed by ``mi'i'': 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d8" name="e17d8">17.8)</a>    li pimu ga'o mi'i ke'i pimu
    the-number 0.5 plus-or-minus 0.5
</pre>
    which expresses the same interval as <a href="#e17d7">Example
    17.7</a>. Note that the ``ga'o'' and ``ke'i'' still refer to
    the endpoints, although these are now implied rather than
    expressed. Another way of expressing the same thing: 
<pre>
<a id="e17d9"
name="e17d9">17.9)</a>    li pimu su'i ni'upimu bi'o ma'upimu
    the-number 0.5 plus [-0.5 from-to +0.5]
</pre>
    Here we have the sum of a number and an interval, which
    produces another interval centered on the number. As <a
    href="#e17d9">Example 17.9</a> shows, non-logical (or logical)
    connection of operands has higher precedence than any mekso
    operator. 

    <p>You can also combine two operands with ``ce'o'', the
    sequence connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound
    subscript:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e17d10"
name="e17d10">17.10)</a>  xy. xi vei by. ce'o dy. [ve'o]
    ``x'' sub ( ``b'' sequence ``d'' )
    x<sub>b,d}
</sub>
</pre>
