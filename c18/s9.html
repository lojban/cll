    <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Approximation and inexact numbers</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ji'i    PA  approximately
    su'e    PA  at most
    su'o    PA  at least
    me'i    PA  less than
    za'u    PA  more than
</pre>
    The cmavo ``ji'i'' (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to
    indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the
    beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  ji'i vo no
    approximation four zero
    approximately 40
</pre>
    If ``ji'i'' appears in the middle of a number, all the digits
    following it are approximate: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  vo no ji'i mu no
    four zero approximation five zero
    roughly 4050
        (where the ``four thousand'' is exact,
        but the ``fifty'' is approximate)
</pre>
    If ``ji'i'' appears at the end of a number, it indicates that
    the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be
    followed by a sign cmavo (``ma'u'' or ``ni'u''), which indicate
    truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively. 
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  re pi ze re ji'i
    two point seven two approximation
    2.72 (rounded)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  re pi ze re ji'i ma'u
    two point seven two approximation positive-sign
    2.72 (rounded up)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  re pi ze pa ji'i ni'u
    two point seven one approximation negative-sign
    2.71 (rounded down)
</pre>
    <a href="#e9d3">Examples 9.3</a> through <a
    href="#e9d5">9.5</a> are all approximations to ``te'o''
    (exponential e). ``ji'i'' can also appear by itself, in which
    case it means ``approximately the typical value in this
    context''. 

    <p>The four cmavo ``su'e'', ``su'o'', ``me'i'', and ``za'u'',
    also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower
    bounds:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi catlu su'e re prenu
    I look-at at-most two persons
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  mi catlu su'o re prenu
    I look-at at-least two persons
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi catlu me'i re prenu
    I look-at less-than two persons
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  mi catlu za'u re prenu
    I look-at more-than two persons
</pre>
    Each of these is a subtly different claim: <a
    href="#e9d7">Example 9.7</a> is true of two or any greater
    number, whereas <a href="#e9d9">Example 9.9</a> requires three
    persons or more. Likewise, <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a>
    refers to zero, one, or two; <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> to
    zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other
    than non-negative integers, ``me'i re'' can be any number less
    than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact
    quantifier, ``exactly 2, neither more nor less'' is just
    ``re''. Note that ``su'ore'' is the exact Lojban equivalent of
    English plurals. 

    <p>If no number follows one of these cmavo, ``pa'' is
    understood: therefore,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>    mi catlu su'o prenu
    I look-at at-least [one] person
</pre>
    is a meaningful claim. 

    <p>Like the numbers in <a href="s8.html">Section 8</a>, all of
    these cmavo may be preceded by ``pi'' to make the corresponding
    quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, ``pisu'o'' means
    ``at least some part of''. The quantifiers ``ro'', ``su'o'',
    ``piro'', and ``pisu'o'' are particularly important in Lojban,
    as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by
    the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in <a
    href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>. Descriptions in general are
    outside the scope of this chapter.</p>
