          <h3><a id="s5" name="s5">5. Simple infix expressions and equations</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   du  GOhA    equals
    su'i    VUhU    plus
    vu'u    VUhU    minus
    pi'i    VUhU    times
    te'a    VUhU    raised to the power
    ny. BY  letter ``n''
    vei VEI left parenthesis
    ve'o    VEhO    right parenthesis
</pre>
    Let us begin at the beginning: one plus one equals two. In
    Lojban, that sentence translates to: 
<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  li pa su'i pa du li re
    the-number one plus one equals the-number two.
    1 + 1 = 2
</pre>
    <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a>, a mekso sentence, is a regular
    Lojban bridi that exploits mekso features. ``du'' is the
    predicate meaning ``x1 is mathematically equal to x2''. It is a
    cmavo for conciseness, but it has the same grammatical uses as
    any brivla. Outside mathematical contexts, ``du'' means ``x1 is
    identical with x2'' or ``x1 is the same object as x2''. 

    <p>The cmavo ``li'' is the number article. It is required
    whenever a sentence talks about numbers as numbers, as opposed
    to using numbers to quantify things. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le ci prenu
    the three persons
</pre>
    requires no ``li'' article, because the ``ci'' is being used to
    specify the number of ``prenu''. However, the sentence 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  levi sfani cu grake li ci
    this fly masses-in-grams the-number three
    This fly has a mass of 3 grams.
</pre>
    requires ``li'' because ``ci'' is being used as a sumti. Note
    that this is the way in which measurements are stated in
    Lojban: all the predicates for units of length, mass,
    temperature, and so on have the measured object as the first
    place and a number as the second place. Using ``li'' for ``le''
    in <a href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> would produce 
<pre>
<a id="e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  li ci prenu
    the-number 3 is-a-person
</pre>
    which is grammatical but nonsensical: numbers are not persons. 

    <p>The cmavo ``su'i'' belongs to selma'o VUhU, which is
    composed of mathematical operators, and means ``addition''. As
    mentioned before, it is distinct from ``ma'u'' which means the
    positive sign as an indication of a positive number:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  li ma'u pa su'i ni'u pa
        du li no
    the-number positive-sign one plus negative-sign one
        equals the-number zero
    +1 + -1 = 0
</pre>

    <p>Of course, it is legal to have complex mekso on both sides
    of ``du'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  li mu su'i pa
        du li ci su'i ci
    the-number five plus one
        equals the-number three plus three
    5 + 1 = 3 + 3
</pre>
    Why don't we say ``li mu su'i li pa'' rather than just ``li mu
    su'i pa''? The answer is that VUhU operators connect mekso
    operands (numbers, in <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>), not
    general sumti. ``li'' is used to make the entire mekso into a
    sumti, which then plays the roles applicable to other sumti: in
    <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>, filling the places of a bridi.
    

    <p>By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator
    mathematics: there is no notion of ``operator precedence''.
    Consider the following example, where ``pi'i'' means ``times'',
    the multiplication operator:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  li ci su'i vo pi'i mu
        du li reci
    the-number three plus four times five
        equals the-number two-three
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 23
</pre>

    <p>Is the Lojban version of <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a>
    true? No! ``3 + 4 &times; 5'' is indeed 23, because the usual
    conventions of mathematics state that multiplication takes
    precedence over addition; that is, the multiplication ``4
    &times; 5'' is done first, giving 20, and only then the
    addition ``3 + 20''. But VUhU operators by default are done
    left to right, like other Lojban grouping, and so a truthful
    bridi would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  li ci su'i vo pi'i mu
        du li cimu
    the-number three plus four times five
        equals the-number three-five
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 35
</pre>
    Here we calculate 3 + 4 first, giving 7, and then calculate 7
    &times; 5 second, leading to the result 35. While possessing
    the advantage of simplicity, this result violates the design
    goal of matching the standards of mathematics. What can be
    done? 

    <p>There are three solutions, all of which will probably be
    used to some degree. The first solution is to ignore the
    problem. People will say ``li ci su'i vo pi'i mu'' and mean 23
    by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence
    over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by
    Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics. This
    convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in
    this one area.</p>

    <p>(Why not hard-wire the precedences into the grammar, as is
    done in computer programming languages? Essentially because
    there are too many operators, known and unknown, with levels of
    precedence that vary according to usage. The programming
    language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of
    operators is not even extensible. For Lojban this approach is
    just not practical. In addition, hard-wired precedence could
    not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets
    where the conventions are different.)</p>

    <p>The second solution is to use explicit means to specify the
    precedence of operators. This approach is fully general, but
    clumsy, and will be explained in <a href="s20.html">Section
    20</a>.</p>

    <p>The third solution is simple but not very general. When an
    operator is prefixed with the cmavo ``bi'e'' (of selma'o BIhE),
    it becomes automatically of higher precedence than other
    operators not so prefixed. Thus,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  li ci su'i vo bi'e pi'i mu
        du li reci
    the-number three plus four-times-five
        equals the-number two-three
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 23
</pre>
    is a truthful Lojban bridi. If more than one operator has a
    ``bi'e'' prefix, grouping is to the right; multiple ``bi'e''
    prefixes on a single operator are not allowed. 

    <p>In addition, of course, Lojban has the mathematical
    parentheses ``vei'' and ``ve'o'', which can be used just like
    their written equivalents ``('' and ``)'' to group expressions
    in any way desired:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d10"
name="e5d10">5.10)</a>    li vei ny. su'i pa ve'o pi'i vei ny. su'i pa [ve'o]
        du li ny. [bi'e] te'a re su'i re bi'e pi'i ny. su'i pa
    the-number ( ``n'' plus one ) times ( ``n'' plus one )
        equals the-number n-power-two plus two-times-``n'' plus 1
    (n + 1)(n + 1) = n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 1
</pre>
    There are several new usages in <a href="#e5d10">Example
    5.10</a>: ``te'a'' means ``raised to the power'', and we also
    see the use of the lerfu word ``ny'', representing the letter
    ``n''. In mekso, letters stand for just what they do in
    ordinary mathematics: variables. The parser will accept a
    string of lerfu words (called a ``lerfu string'') as the
    equivalent of a single lerfu word, in agreement with
    computer-science conventions; ``abc'' is a single variable, not
    the equivalent of ``a &times; b &times; c''. (Of course, a
    local convention could state that the value of a variable like
    ``abc'', with a multi-lerfu name, was equal to the values of
    the variables ``a'', ``b'', and ``c'' multiplied together.) 

    <p>The explicit operator ``pi'i'' is required in the Lojban
    verbal form whereas multiplication is implicit in the symbolic
    form. Note that ``ve'o'' (the right parenthesis) is an elidable
    terminator: the first use of it in <a href="#e5d10">Example
    5.10</a> is required, but the second use (marked by square
    brackets) could be elided. Additionally, the first ``bi'e''
    (also marked by square brackets) is not necessary to get the
    proper grouping, but it is included here for symmetry with the
    other one.</p>
