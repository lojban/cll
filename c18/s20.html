          <h3><a id="s20" name="s20"><sub>20. Explicit operator precedence</sub></h3>

    <p><sub>As mentioned earlier, Lojban does provide a way for the
    precedences of operators to be explicitly declared, although
    current parsers do not understand these declarations.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>The declaration is made in the form of a metalinguistic
    comment using ``ti'o'', a member of selma'o SEI. ``sei'', the
    other member of SEI, is used to insert metalinguistic comments
    on a bridi which give information about the discourse which the
    bridi comprises. The format of a ``ti'o'' declaration has not
    been formally established, but presumably would take the form
    of mentioning a mekso operator and then giving it either an
    absolute numerical precedence on some pre-established scale, or
    else specifying relative precedences between new operators and
    existing operators.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>In future, we hope to create an improved machine parser
    that can understand declarations of the precedences of simple
    operators belonging to selma'o VUhU. Originally, all operators
    would have the same precedence. Declarations would have the
    effect of raising the specified cmavo of VUhU to higher
    precedence levels. Complex operators formed with ``na'u'',
    ``ni'e'', or ``ma'o'' would remain at the standard low
    precedence; declarations with respect to them are for future
    implementation efforts. It is probable that such a parser would
    have a set of ``commonly assumed precedences'' built into it
    (selectable by a special ``ti'o'' declaration) that would match
    mathematical intuition: times higher than plus, and so
    on.</sub></p>
