          <h3><a id="s21" name="s21"><sub>21. Miscellany</sub></h3>

    <p><sub>A few other points:</sub></p>

    <p><sub>``se'' can be used to convert an operator as if it were
    a selbri, so that its arguments are exchanged. For
    example:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d1" name="e21d1">21.1)</a>    li ci se vu'u vo
        du li pa
    the-number three (inverse) minus four
        equals the-number one.
    3 subtracted from 4 equals 1.
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>The other converters of selma'o SE can also be used on
    operators with more than two operands, and they can be
    compounded to create (probably unintelligible) operators as
    needed.</sub>

    <p><sub>Members of selma'o NAhE are also legal on an operator
    to produce a scalar negation of it. The implication is that
    some other operator would apply to make the bridi
    true:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d2"
name="e21d2">21.2)</a>    li ci na'e su'i vo du li pare
    the-number 3 non-plus 4 equals the-number 12
</sub>
</pre>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d3"
name="e21d3">21.3)</a>    li ci to'e vu'u re du li mu
    the-number 3 opposite-of-minus 2 equals the-number 5
</sub>
</pre>

    <p><sub>The sense in which ``plus'' is the opposite of
    ``minus'' is not a mathematical but rather a linguistic one;
    negated operators are defined only loosely.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>``la'e'' and ``lu'e'' can be used on operands with the
    usual semantics to get the referent of or a symbol for an
    operand. Likewise, a member of selma'o NAhE followed by ``bo''
    serves to scalar-negate an operand, implying that some other
    operand would make the bridi true:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d4"
name="e21d4">21.4)</a>    li re su'i re du li na'ebo mu
    the-number 2 plus 2 equals the-number non-5.
    2 + 2 = something other than 5.
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>The digits 0-9 have rafsi, and therefore can be used in
    making lujvo. Additionally, all the rafsi have CVC form and can
    stand alone or together as names:</sub>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d5" name="e21d5">21.5)</a>    la zel. poi gunta
        la tebes. pu nanmu
    those-named ``Seven'' who attack
        that-named ``Thebes'' [past] are-men
    The Seven Against Thebes were men.
</sub>
</pre>

    <p><sub>Of course, there is no guarantee that the name ``zel.''
    is connected with the number rafsi: an alternative which cannot
    be misconstrued is:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e21d6" name="e21d6">21.6)</a>    la zemei poi gunta
        la tebes. pu nanmu
    those-named-the Sevensome who attack
        Thebes [past] are-men.
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>Certain other members of PA also have assigned rafsi:
    ``so'a'', ``so'e'', ``so'i'', ``so'o'', ``so'u'', ``da'a'',
    ``ro'', ``su'e'', ``su'o'', ``pi'', and ``ce'i''. Furthermore,
    although the cmavo ``fi'u'' does not have a rafsi as such, it
    is closely related to the gismu ``frinu'', meaning
    ``fraction''; therefore, in a context of numeric rafsi, you can
    use any of the rafsi for ``frinu'' to indicate a fraction
    slash.</sub>

    <p><sub>A similar convention is used for the cmavo ``cu'o'' of
    selma'o MOI, which is closely related to ``cunso''
    (probability); use a rafsi for ``cunso'' in order to create
    lujvo based on ``cu'o''. The cmavo ``mei'' and ``moi'' of MOI
    have their own rafsi, two each in fact: ``mem''/``mei'' and
    ``mom''/``moi'' respectively.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>The grammar of mekso as described so far imposes a
    rigid distinction between operators and operands. Some flavors
    of mathematics (lambda calculus, algebra of functions) blur
    this distinction, and Lojban must have a method of doing the
    same. An operator can be changed into an operand with
    ``ni'enu'a'', which transforms the operator into a matching
    selbri and then the selbri into an operand.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>To change an operand into an operator, we use the cmavo
    ``ma'o'', already introduced as a means of changing a lerfu
    string such as ``fy.'' into an operator. In fact, ``ma'o'' can
    be followed by any mekso operand, using the elidable terminator
    ``te'u'' if necessary.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>There is a potential semantic ambiguity in ``ma'o fy.
    [te'u]'' if ``fy.'' is already in use as a variable: it comes
    to mean ``the function whose value is always 'f'''. However,
    mathematicians do not normally use the same lerfu words or
    strings as both functions and variables, so this case should
    not arise in practice.</sub></p>
