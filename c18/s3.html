    <h3><a id="s3" name="s3">3. Signs and numerical punctuation</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ma'u    PA  positive sign
    ni'u    PA  negative sign
    pi  PA  decimal point
    fi'u    PA  fraction slash
    ra'e    PA  repeating decimal
    ce'i    PA  percent sign
    ki'o    PA  comma between digits
</pre>
    A number can be given an explicit sign by the use of ``ma'u''
    and ``ni'u'', which are the positive and negative signs as
    distinct from the addition, subtraction, and negation
    operators. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  ni'u pa
    negative-sign 1
    -1
</pre>
    Grammatically, the signs are part of the number to which they
    are attached. It is also possible to use ``ma'u'' and ``ni'u''
    by themselves as numbers; the meaning of these numbers is
    explained in <a href="s8.html">Section 8</a>. 

    <p>Various numerical punctuation marks are likewise expressed
    by cmavo, as illustrated in the following examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  ci pi pa vo pa mu
    three point one four one five
    3.1415
</pre>
    (In some cultures, a comma is used instead of a period in the
    symbolic version of <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>; ``pi'' is
    still the Lojban representation for the decimal point.) 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  re fi'u ze
    two fraction seven
    2/7
</pre>
    <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> is the name of the number
    two-sevenths; it is not the same as ``the result of 2 divided
    by 7'' in Lojban, although numerically these two are equal. If
    the denominator of the fraction is present but the numerator is
    not, the numerator is taken to be 1, thus expressing the
    reciprocal of the following number: 
<pre>
<a id="e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  fi'u ze
    fraction seven
    1/7
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  pi ci mu ra'e pa vo re bi mu ze
    point three five repeating one four two eight five seven
    .35142857142857...
</pre>
    Note that the ``ra'e'' marks unambiguously where the repeating
    portion ``142857'' begins. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  ci mu ce'i
    three five percent
    35%
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  pa ki'o re ci vo ki'o mu xa ze
    one comma two three four comma five six seven
    1,234,567
</pre>
    (In some cultures, spaces are used in the symbolic
    representation of <a href="#e3d7">Example 3.7</a>; ``ki'o'' is
    still the Lojban representation.) 

    <p>It is also possible to have less than three digits between
    successive ``ki'o''s, in which case zeros are assumed to have
    been elided:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>  pa ki'o re ci ki'o vo
    one comma two three comma four
    1,023,004
</pre>

    <p>In the same way, ``ki'o'' can be used after ``pi'' to divide
    fractions into groups of three:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  pi ki'o re re
    point comma two two
    .022

<a id="e3d10" name="e3d10">3.10)</a>   pi pa ki'o pa re ki'o pa
    point one comma one two comma one
    .101012001
</pre>
