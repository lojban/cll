    <h3><a id="s19" name="s19"><sub>19. Other uses of mekso</sub></h3>

    <p><sub>The following cmavo are discussed in this
    section:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub>   me'o    LI  the mekso
    nu'a    NUhA    operator to selbri
    mai MAI utterance ordinal
    mo'o    MAI higher order utterance ordinal
    roi ROI quantified tense
</sub>
</pre>

    <p><sub>So far we have seen mekso used as sumti (with ``li''),
    as quantifiers (often parenthesized), and in MOI and ME-MOI
    selbri. There are a few other minor uses of mekso within
    Lojban.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>The cmavo ``me'o'' has the same grammatical use as
    ``li'' but slightly different semantics. ``li'' means ``the
    number which is the value of the mekso ...'', whereas ``me'o''
    just means ``the mekso ...'' So it is true that:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d1" name="e19d1">19.1)</a>    li re su'i re du li vo
    the-number two plus two equals the-number four
    2 + 2 = 4
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>but false that:</sub>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d2"
name="e19d2">19.2)</a>    me'o re su'i re du me'o vo
    the-mekso two plus two equals the-mekso four
    ``2 + 2'' = ``4''
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>since the expressions ``2 + 2'' and ``4'' are not the
    same. The relationship between ``li'' and ``me'o'' is related
    to that between ``la djan.'', the person named John, and ``zo
    .djan.'', the name ``John''.</sub>

    <p><sub>The cmavo ``nu'a'' is the inverse of ``na'u'', and
    allows a mekso operator to be used as a normal selbri, with the
    place structure:</sub></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><sub></sub></dt>

      <dd><sub>x1 is the result of applying (operator) to x2, x3,
      ...</sub></dd>
    </dl>
    <sub>f or as many places as may be required. For example:</sub>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d3"
name="e19d3">19.3)</a>    li ni'umu cu nu'a va'a li ma'umu
    the-number -5 is-the-negation-of the-number +5
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>uses ``nu'a'' to make the operator ``va'a'' into a
    two-place bridi.</sub>

    <p><sub>Used together, ``nu'a'' and ``na'u'' make it possible
    to ask questions about mekso operators, even though there is no
    specific cmavo for an operator question, nor is it grammatical
    to utter an operator in isolation. Consider <a
    href="#e19d4">Example 19.4</a>, to which <a
    href="#e19d5">Example 19.5</a> is one correct answer:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d4"
name="e19d4">19.4)</a>    li re na'u mo re du li vo
    the-number two what-operator? two equals the-number four
    2 ? 2 = 4

<a id="e19d5" name="e19d5">19.5)</a> nu'a su'i
    plus
</sub>
</pre>

    <p><sub>In <a href="#e19d4">Example 19.4</a>, ``na'u mo'' is an
    operator question, because ``mo'' is the selbri question cmavo
    and ``na'u'' makes the selbri into an operator. <a
    href="#e19d5">Example 19.5</a> makes the true answer ``su'i''
    into a selbri (which is a legal utterance) with the inverse
    cmavo ``nu'a''. Mechanically speaking, inserting <a
    href="#e19d5">Example 19.5</a> into <a href="#e19d4">Example
    19.4</a> produces:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d6"
name="e19d6">19.6)</a>    li re na'u nu'a su'i re du li vo
    the-number two (the-operator the-selbri plus)
        two equals the-number four
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>where the ``na'u nu'a'' cancels out, leaving a truthful
    bridi.</sub>

    <p><sub>Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English
    ``firstly'', ``secondly'', and so on, can be created by
    suffixing a member of selma'o MAI to a digit string or a lerfu
    string. (Digit strings are compound cmavo beginning with a
    cmavo of selma'o PA, and containing only cmavo of PA or BY;
    lerfu strings begin with a cmavo of selma'o BY, and likewise
    contain only PA or BY cmavo.) Here are some examples:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e19d7" name="e19d7">19.7)</a>    pamai
    firstly

<a id="e19d8" name="e19d8">19.8)</a> remai
    secondly

<a id="e19d9" name="e19d9">19.9)</a> romai
    all-ly
    lastly

<a id="e19d10" name="e19d10">19.10)</a>   ny.mai
    nth-ly

<a id="e19d11" name="e19d11">19.11)</a>   pasomo'o
    nineteenthly (higher order)
    <a href="s19.html">Section 19</a>
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub>The difference between ``mai'' and ``mo'o'' is that
    ``mo'o'' enumerates larger subdivisions of a text. Each
    ``mo'o'' subdivision can then be divided into pieces and
    internally numbered with ``mai''. If this chapter were
    translated into Lojban, it would number each section with
    ``mo'o''.</sub>

    <p><sub>A numerical tense can be created by suffixing a digit
    string with ``roi''. This usage generates tenses corresponding
    to English ``once'', ``twice'', and so on. This topic belongs
    to a detailed discussion of Lojban tenses, and is explained
    further in <a href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>Note: the elidable terminator ``boi'' is not used
    between a number and a member of MAI or ROI.</sub></p>
