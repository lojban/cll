    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Vectors and matrices</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   jo'i    JOhI    start vector
    te'u    TEhU    end vector
    pi'a    VUhU    matrix row combiner
    sa'i    VUhU    matrix column combiner
</pre>
    A mathematical vector is a list of numbers, and a mathematical
    matrix is a table of numbers. Lojban considers matrices to be
    built up out of vectors, which are in turn built up out of
    operands. 

    <p>``jo'i'', the only cmavo of selma'o JOhI, is the vector
    indicator: it has a syntax reminiscent of a forethought
    operator, but has very high precedence. The components must be
    simple operands rather than full expressions (unless
    parenthesized). A vector can have any number of components;
    ``te'u'' is the elidable terminator. An example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d1"
name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    li jo'i paboi reboi te'u su'i jo'i ciboi voboi
        du li jo'i voboi xaboi
    the-number array( one, two ) plus array( three, four)
        equals the-number array( four, six)
    (1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
</pre>
    Vectors can be combined into matrices using either ``pi'a'',
    the matrix row operator, or ``sa'i'', the matrix column
    operator. The first combines vectors representing rows of the
    matrix, and the second combines vectors representing columns of
    the matrix. Both of them allow any number of arguments:
    additional arguments are tacked on with the null operator
    ``ge'a''. 

    <p>Therefore, the ``magic square'' matrix</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>8 1 6 3 5 7 4 9 2</dd>
    </dl>
    can be represented either as: 
<pre>
<a id="e15d2"
name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    jo'i biboi paboi xa pi'a jo'i ciboi muboi ze
        ge'a jo'i voboi soboi re
    the-vector (8 1 6) matrix-row the-vector (3 5 7)
        , the-vector (4 9 2)
</pre>
    or as 
<pre>
<a id="e15d3"
name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    jo'i biboi ciboi vo sa'i jo'i paboi muboi so
        ge'a jo'i xaboi zeboi re
    the-vector (8 3 4) matrix-column the-vector (1 5 9)
        , the-vector (6 7 2)
</pre>
    The regular mekso operators can be applied to vectors and to
    matrices, since grammatically both of these are expressions. It
    is usually necessary to parenthesize matrices when used with
    operators in order to avoid incorrect groupings. There are no
    VUhU operators for the matrix operators of inner or outer
    products, but appropriate operators can be created using a
    suitable symbolic lerfu word or string prefixed by ``ma'o''. 

    <p>Matrices of more than two dimensions can be built up using
    either ``pi'a'' or ``sa'i'' with an appropriate subscript
    numbering the dimension. When subscripted, there is no
    difference between ``pi'a'' and ``sa'i''.</p>
