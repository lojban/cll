          <h3>16. Interval connectives and forethought non-logical
    connection</h3>

    <p>In addition to the non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI
    explained in <a href=../14/>Sections 14</a> and <a
    href=../15/>15</a>, there are three other connectives which can
    appear in joiks: ``bi'i'', ``bi'o'', and ``mi'i'', all of
    selma'o BIhI. The first two cmavo are used to specify
    intervals: abstract objects defined by two endpoints. The cmavo
    ``bi'i'' is correct if the endpoints are independent of order,
    whereas ``bi'o'' or ``sebi'o'' are used when order matters.</p>

    <p>An example of ``bi'i'' in sumti connection:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">16.1)</a>    mi ca sanli
        la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand-on-surface
        Dresden [interval] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt.
</pre>
    In <a href="../16/#1">Example 16.1</a>, it is all the same
    whether I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt or between
    Frankfurt and Dresden, so ``bi'i'' is the appropriate interval
    connective. The sumti ``la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.'' falls
    into the x2 place of ``sanli'', which is the surface I stand
    on; the interval specifies that surface by its limits.
    (Obviously, I am not standing on the whole of the interval; the
    x2 place of ``sanli'' specifies a surface which is typically
    larger in extent than just the size of the stander's feet.) 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">16.2)</a>    mi cadzu ca
        la pacac. bi'o la recac.
    I walk simultaneous-with
        First-hour [ordered-interval] Second-hour.
    I walk from one o'clock to two o'clock.
</pre>
    In <a href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a>, on the other hand, it is
    essential that ``la pacac.'' comes before ``la recac.'';
    otherwise we have an 11-hour (or 23-hour) interval rather than
    a one-hour interval. In this use of an interval, the whole
    interval is probably intended, or at least most of it. 

    <p><a href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a> is equivalent to:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">16.3)</a>    mi cadzu ca
        la recac. sebi'o la pacac.
    I walk simultaneous-with
        Second-hour [reverse] [ordered] First-hour.
</pre>

    <p>English cannot readily express ``sebi'o'', but its meaning
    can be understood by reversing the two sumti.</p>

    <p>The third cmavo of selma'o BIhI, namely ``mi'i'', expresses
    an interval seen from a different viewpoint: not a pair of
    endpoints, but a center point and a distance. For example:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="16-4"
name="16-4">16.4)</a>    le jbama pu daspo la .uacintyn.
        mi'i lo minli be li muno
    the bomb [past] destroys Washington
        [center] what-is measured-in-miles by 50.
    The bomb destroyed Washington and fifty miles around.
</pre>

    <p>Here we have an interval whose center is Washington and
    whose distance, or radius, is fifty miles.</p>

    <p>In <a href="../16/#1">Example 16.1</a>, is it possible that I
    am standing in Dresden (or Frankfurt) itself? Yes. The
    connectives of selma'o BIhI are ambiguous about whether the
    endpoints themselves are included in or excluded from the
    interval. Two auxiliary cmavo ``ga'o'' and ``ke'i'' (of cmavo
    GAhO) are used to indicate the status of the endpoints:
    ``ga'o'' means that the endpoint is included, ``ke'i'' that it
    is excluded:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">16.5)</a>    mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ga'o bi'i ga'o la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [inclusive] [interval] [inclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt,
        inclusive of both.

<a id="6" name="6">16.6)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ga'o bi'i ke'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [inclusive] [interval] [exclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (inclusive)
        and Frankfurt (exclusive).

<a id="7" name="7">16.7)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ke'i bi'i ga'o la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [exclusive] [interval] [inclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (exclusive)
        and Frankfurt (inclusive).

<a id="8" name="8">16.8)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ke'i bi'i ke'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [exclusive] [interval] [exclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt,
        exclusive of both.
</pre>
    As these examples should make clear, the GAhO cmavo that
    applies to a given endpoint is the one that stands physically
    adjacent to it: the left-hand endpoint is referred to by the
    first GAhO, and the right-hand endpoint by the second GAhO. It
    is ungrammatical to have just one GAhO. 

    <p>(Etymologically, ``ga'o'' is derived from ``ganlo'', which
    means ``closed'', and ``ke'i'' from ``kalri'', which means
    ``open''. In mathematics, inclusive intervals are referred to
    as closed intervals, and exclusive intervals as open ones.)</p>

    <p>BIhI joiks are grammatical anywhere that other joiks are,
    including in tanru connection and (as ijoiks) between
    sentences. No meanings have been found for these uses.</p>

    <p>Negated intervals, marked with a ``-nai'' following the BIhI
    cmavo, indicate an interval that includes everything but what
    is between the endpoints (with respect to some understood
    scale):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="16-9"
name="16-9">16.9)</a>    do dicra .e'a mi ca la daucac. bi'onai la gaicac.
    You disturb (allowed) me at 10 not-from ... to 12
    You can contact me except from 10 to 12.
</pre>

    <p>The complete syntax of joiks is:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[se] JOI [nai] [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO [se] BIhI [nai]
      GAhO</dd>
    </dl>
    Notice that the colloquial English translations of ``bi'i'' and
    ``bi'o'' have forethought form: ``between ... and'' for
    ``bi'i'', and ``from ... to'' for ``bi'o''. In Lojban too,
    non-logical connectives can be expressed in forethought. Rather
    than using a separate selma'o, the forethought logical
    connectives are constructed from the afterthought ones by
    suffixing ``gi''. Such a compound cmavo is not unnaturally
    called a ``joigik''; the syntax of joigiks is any of: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[se] JOI [nai] GI [se] BIhI [nai] GI GAhO [se] BIhI [nai]
      GAhO GI</dd>
    </dl>
    Joigiks may be used to non-logically connect bridi, sumti, and
    bridi-tails; and also in termsets. 

    <p><a href="../14/#3">Example 14.3</a> in forethought
    becomes:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="16-10"
name="16-10">16.10)</a>  joigi la djan. gi la .alis. bevri le pipno
    [Together] John and Alice carry the piano.
</pre>

    <p>The first ``gi'' is part of the joigik; the second ``gi'' is
    the regular gik that separates the two things being connected
    in all forethought forms.</p>

    <p><a href="../16/#6">Example 16.6</a> can be expressed in
    forethought as:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">16.11)</a>  mi ca sanli ke'i bi'i ga'o
        gi la drezdn.
        gi la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand
        [exclusive] between [inclusive] Dresden
        and Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (exclusive)
        and Frankfurt (inclusive).
</pre>
    In forethought, unfortunately, the GAhOs become physically
    separated from the endpoints, but the same rule applies: the
    first GAhO refers to the first endpoint.
