          <h3>15. More about non-logical connectives</h3>

    <p>The final three JOI cmavo, “jo'e”, “ku'a”, and “pi'u”,
    are probably only useful when talking explicitly about sets.
    They represent three standard set operators usually called
    “union”, “intersection”, and “cross product” (also known
    as “Cartesian product”). The union of two sets is a set
    containing all the members that are in either set; the
    intersection of two sets is a set containing all the members
    that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets is the set
    of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains
    a single element from the first set followed by a single
    element from the second. This may seem very abstract;
    hopefully, the following examples will help:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="15-1"
name="15-1">15.1)</a>    lo'i ricfu ku jo'e lo'i dotco
        cu barda
    The-set-of rich-things union the-set-of German-things
        is large.
    
<a id="2" name="2">15.2)</a> lo'i ricfu ku ku'a
        lo'i dotco cu cmalu
    The set-of rich-things intersection
        the-set-of German-things is small.
</pre>
    There is a parallelism between logic and set theory that makes
    <a href="../15/#1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="../15/#2">Example
    15.2</a> equivalent respectively to: 
<pre>
<a id="15-3"
name="15-3">15.3)</a>    lo'i ricfu ja dotco cu barda
    The-set-of rich-or-German-things is large.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="15-4"
name="15-4">15.4)</a>    lo'i ricfu je dotco cu cmalu
    The-set-of rich-and-German-things is small.
</pre>

    <p>The following example uses “se remei”, which is a set (not
    a mass) of two elements:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="15-5"
name="15-5">15.5)</a>    la djeimyz. ce[bo] la djordj.
        pi'u la meris. cebo la martas.
        cu prami se remei
    James and-set George
        cross-product Mary and-set Martha
        are-lover type-of-pairs.
</pre>
    means that each of the pairs James/Mary, George/Mary,
    James/Martha, and George/Martha love each other. Therefore it
    is similar in meaning to <a href="../14/#13">Example 14.13</a>;
    however, that example speaks only of the men loving the women,
    not vice versa. 

    <p>Joiks may be combined with “bo” or with “ke” in the same
    way as eks and jeks; this allows grouping of non-logical
    connections between sumti and tanru units, in complete
    parallelism with logical connections:</p>
<pre>
<a id="15-6"
name="15-6">15.6)</a>    mi joibo do ce la djan. joibo la djein.
        cu gunma se remei
    (I massed-with you) and (John massed-with Jane)
        are-a-mass type-of-two-set
</pre>
    asserts that there is a set of two items each of which is a
    mass. 

    <p>Non-logical connection is permitted at the joint of a
    termset; this is useful for associating more than one sumti or
    tagged sumti with each side of the non-logical connection. The
    place structure of “casnu” is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the mass x1 discusses/talks about x2</dd>
    </dl>
    so the x1 place must be occupied by a mass (for reasons not
    explained here); however, different components of the mass may
    discuss in different languages. To associate each participant
    with his or her language, we can say: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">15.7)</a>     mi ce'e bau la lojban.
        pe'e joi do ce'e bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
    ( I [plus] in-language Lojban
        massed-with you [plus] in-language English ) discuss.
</pre>

    <p>Like all non-logical connectives, the usage shown in <a
    href="../15/#7">Example 15.7</a> cannot be mechanically converted
    into a non-logical connective placed at another location in the
    bridi. The forethought equivalent of <a href="../15/#7">Example
    15.7</a> is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="15-8"
name="15-8">15.8)</a>     nu'i joigi mi bau la lojban
        gi do bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
</pre>
    Non-logical forethought termsets are also useful when the
    things to be non-logically connected are sumti preceded with
    tense or modal (BAI) tags: 
<pre>
<a id="15-9"
name="15-9">15.9)</a>    la djan. fa'u la frank. cusku
        nu'i bau la lojban.
        nu'u fa'u
            bai la djordj. [nu'u]
    John respectively-with Frank express
        [start termset] in-language Lojban
        [joint] respectively-with
            under-compulsion-by George.
    John and Frank speak in Lojban and under George’s
        compulsion, respectively.
</pre>
    <a href="../14/#17">Example 14.17</a> associates speaking in
    Lojban with John, and speaking under George’s compulsion with
    Frank. We do not know what language Frank uses, or whether John
    speaks under anyone’s compulsion. 

    <p>Joiks may be prefixed with “.i” to produce ijoiks, which
    serve to non-logically connect sentences. The main known use
    here is “.ice'o”, which indicates that the event of the
    second bridi follows that of the first bridi in some way other
    than a time relationship (which is handled with a tense):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">15.10)</a>  mi ba gasnu la'edi'e
        .i tu'e kanji lo ni cteki
        .ice'o lumci le karce
        .ice'o dzukansa le gerku tu'u
    I [future] do the-referent-of-the-following:
        ( Compute the quantity of taxes.
        And-then wash the car.
        And-then walkingly-accompany the dog. )
    List of things to do:
        Figure taxes.
        Wash car.
        Walk dog.
</pre>
    <a href="../15/#10">Example 15.10</a> represents a list of things
    to be done in priority order. The order is important, hence the
    need for a sequence connective, but does not necessarily
    represent a time order (the dog may end up getting walked
    first). Note the use of “tu'e” and “tu'u” as general
    brackets around the whole list. This is related to, but
    distinct from, their use in <a href=../8/>Section 8</a>,
    because there is no logical connective between the introductory
    phrase “mi ba gasnu la'edi'e” and the rest. The brackets
    effectively show how large an utterance the word “di'e”,
    which means “the following utterance”, refers to. 

    <p>The following “nai”, if present, does not negate either of
    the things to be connected, but instead specifies that some
    other connection (logical or non-logical) is applicable: it is
    a scalar negation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">15.11)</a>  mi jo'unai do cu remei
    I in-common-with [not!] you are-a-twosome
</pre>

    <p>The result of “mi jo'u do” would be two individuals, not a
    mass, therefore “jo'u” is not applicable; “joi” would be
    the correct connective.</p>

    <p>There is no joik question cmavo as such; however, joiks and
    ijoiks may be uttered in isolation in response to a logical
    connective question, as in the following exchange:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">15.12)</a>  do djica tu'a
        loi ckafi
        ji loi tcati
    You desire something-about
        a-mass-of coffee [what connective?]
        a-mass-of tea?
    Do you want coffee or tea?

<a id="13" name="13">15.13)</a>   joi
    Mixed-mass-and.
    Both as a mass (i.e, mixed together).
</pre>
    Ugh. (Or in Lojban: .a'unaisairo'o.)
