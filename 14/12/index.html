          <h3>12. Logical connection within tanru</h3>

    <p>As noted at the beginning of <a href=../9/>Section 9</a>,
    there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and
    nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical
    connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that
    involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru
    “blanu zdani”, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball,
    in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is
    both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of “blanu bolci”,
    Lojbanists can say “blanu je bolci”, using a jek connective
    within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in <a href=../11/>Section
    11</a> also, but there they were always prefixed by “pe'e”;
    in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of
    examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">12.1)</a>    ti blanu zdani
    This is-a-blue type-of house.

<a id="2" name="2">12.2)</a> ti blanu je zdani
    This is-blue and a-house.
</pre>
    But of course <a href="../12/#1">Example 12.1</a> and <a
    href="../12/#2">Example 12.2</a> are not necessarily equivalent
    in meaning! It is the most elementary point about Lojban tanru
    that <a href="../12/#1">Example 12.1</a> might just as well mean 
<pre>
<a id="12-3"
name="12-3">12.3)</a>    This is a house for blue inhabitants.
</pre>
    and <a href="../12/#2">Example 12.2</a> certainly is not
    equivalent in meaning to <a href="../12/#3">Example 12.3</a>. 

    <p>A full explanation of logical connection within tanru
    belongs rather to a discussion of selbri structure than to
    logical connectives in general. Why? Because although <a
    href="../12/#2">Example 12.2</a> happens to mean the same as</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">12.4)</a>    ti blanu gi'e zdani
</pre>
    and therefore as 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">12.5)</a>    ti blanu .ije ti zdani
</pre>
    the rule of expansion into separate bridi simply does not
    always work for tanru connection. Supposing Alice to be a
    person who lives in blue houses, then 
<pre>
<a id="12-6"
name="12-6">12.6)</a>    la .alis. cu blanu je zdani prenu
    Alice is-a (blue and house) type-of-person.
</pre>
    would be true, because tanru grouping with a jek has higher
    precedence than unmarked tanru grouping, but: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">12.7)</a>    la .alis. cu blanu prenu
        .ije la .alis. cu zdani prenu
    Alice is-a blue person,
        and Alice is-a house person.
</pre>
    is probably false, because the blueness is associated with the
    house, not with Alice, even leaving aside the question of what
    it means to say “Alice is a blue person”. (Perhaps she
    belongs to the Blue team, or is wearing blue clothes.) The
    semantic ambiguity of tanru make such logical manipulations
    impossible. 

    <p>It suffices to note here, then, a few purely grammatical
    points about tanru logical connection. “bo” may be appended
    to jeks as to eks, with the same rules:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-8"
name="12-8">12.8)</a>    la teris. cu ricfu je nakni jabo fetsi
    Terry is rich and (male or female).
</pre>
    The components of tanru may be grouped with “ke” both before
    and after a logical connective: 
<pre>
<a id="12-9"
name="12-9">12.9)</a>    la .teris. cu [ke] ricfu ja pindi [ke'e]
        je ke nakni ja fetsi [ke'e]
    Terry is (rich or poor)
        and (male or female).
</pre>
    where the first “ke ... ke'e” pair may be omitted altogether
    by the rule of left-grouping, but is optionally permitted (as
    in bridi connection). In any case, both instances of “ke'e”
    may be elided. 

    <p>The syntax of jeks is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[na] [se] JA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
    parallel to eks and giheks. 

    <p>Forethought tanru connection does not use geks, but uses
    guheks instead. Guheks have exactly the same form as geks:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[se] GUhA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
    Using guheks in tanru connection (rather than geks) resolves
    what would otherwise be an unacceptable ambiguity between
    bridi-tail and tanru connection: 
<pre>
<a id="12-10"
name="12-10">12.10)</a>  la .alis. gu'e ricfu gi fetsi
    Alice is both rich and female.
</pre>
    Note that giks are used with guheks in exactly the same way
    they are used with geks. Like jeks, guheks bind more closely
    than unmarked tanru grouping does: 
<pre>
<a id="12-11"
name="12-11">12.11)</a>  la .alis. gu'e blanu gi zdani prenu
    Alice is-a-(both blue and a-house) type-of-person.
</pre>
    is the forethought version of <a href="../12/#6">Example
    12.6</a>. 

    <p>A word of caution about the use of logically connected tanru
    within descriptions. English-based intuition can lead the
    speaker astray. In correctly reducing</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-12"
name="12-12">12.12)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .ije mi viska pa ninmu
    I see a man, and I see a woman.
</pre>
    to 
<pre>
<a id="12-13"
name="12-13">12.13)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .e pa ninmu
    I see a man and a woman.
</pre>
    there is a great temptation to reduce further to: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="14" name="14">12.14)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu je ninmu
    I see a man and woman.
</pre>

    <p>But <a href="../12/#14">Example 12.14</a> means that you see
    one thing which is both a man and a woman simultaneously! A
    “nanmu je ninmu” is a manwoman, a presumably non-existent
    creature who is both a “nanmu” and a “ninmu”.</p>
