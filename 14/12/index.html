<h3>12. Logical connection within tanru</h3>
<p>As noted at the beginning of <a href="../9/">Section 9</a>, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru “blanu zdani”, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of “blanu bolci”, Lojbanists can say “blanu je bolci”, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in <a href="../11/">Section 11</a> also, but there they were always prefixed by “pe'e”; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">12.1)</a>  ti blanu zdani
       This is-a-blue type-of house.

<a id="e2" name="e2">12.2)</a>  ti blanu je zdani
       This is-blue and a-house.
</pre>
<p>But of course <a href="../12/#e1">Example 12.1</a> and <a href="../12/#e2">Example 12.2</a> are not necessarily equivalent in meaning! It is the most elementary point about Lojban tanru that <a href="../12/#e1">Example 12.1</a> might just as well mean</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">12.3)</a>  This is a house for blue inhabitants.
</pre>
and <a href="../12/#e2">Example 12.2</a> certainly is not equivalent in meaning to <a href="../12/#e3">Example 12.3</a>.
<p>A full explanation of logical connection within tanru belongs rather to a discussion of selbri structure than to logical connectives in general. Why? Because although <a href="../12/#e2">Example 12.2</a> happens to mean the same as</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">12.4)</a>  ti blanu gi'e zdani
</pre>
and therefore as
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">12.5)</a>  ti blanu .ije ti zdani
</pre>
the rule of expansion into separate bridi simply does not always work for tanru connection. Supposing Alice to be a person who lives in blue houses, then
<pre>
<a id="e6" name="e6">12.6)</a>  la .alis. cu blanu je zdani prenu
       Alice is-a ( blue and house ) type-of-person.
</pre>
would be true, because tanru grouping with a jek has higher precedence than unmarked tanru grouping, but:
<pre>
<a id="e7" name="e7">12.7)</a>  la .alis. cu blanu prenu .ije la .alis. cu zdani prenu
       Alice is-a blue person, and Alice is-a house person.
</pre>
is probably false, because the blueness is associated with the house, not with Alice, even leaving aside the question of what it means to say “Alice is a blue person”. (Perhaps she belongs to the Blue team, or is wearing blue clothes.) The semantic ambiguity of tanru make such logical manipulations impossible.
<p>It suffices to note here, then, a few purely grammatical points about tanru logical connection. “bo” may be appended to jeks as to eks, with the same rules:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8" name="e8">12.8)</a>  la teris. cu ricfu je nakni jabo fetsi
       Terry is rich and ( male or female ).
</pre>
The components of tanru may be grouped with “ke” both before and after a logical connective:
<pre>
<a id="e9" name="e9">12.9)</a>  la .teris. cu [ke] ricfu ja pindi [ke'e] je ke nakni ja fetsi [ke'e]
       Terry is (rich or poor) and (male or female).
</pre>
where the first “ke ... ke'e” pair may be omitted altogether by the rule of left-grouping, but is optionally permitted. In any case, the last instance of “ke'e” may be elided.
<p>The syntax of jeks is:</p>
<pre>
       [na] [se] JA [nai]
</pre>
parallel to eks and giheks.
<p>Forethought tanru connection does not use geks, but uses guheks instead. Guheks have exactly the same form as geks:</p>
<pre>
       [se] GUhA [nai]
</pre>
Using guheks in tanru connection (rather than geks) resolves what would otherwise be an unacceptable ambiguity between bridi-tail and tanru connection:
<pre>
<a id="e10" name="e10">12.10)</a> la .alis. gu'e ricfu gi fetsi
       Alice is both rich and female.
</pre>
Note that giks are used with guheks in exactly the same way they are used with geks. Like jeks, guheks bind more closely than unmarked tanru grouping does:
<pre>
<a id="e11" name="e11">12.11)</a> la .alis. gu'e blanu gi zdani prenu
       Alice is-a-(both blue and a-house) type-of-person.
</pre>
is the forethought version of <a href="../12/#e6">Example 12.6</a>.
<p>A word of caution about the use of logically connected tanru within descriptions. English-based intuition can lead the speaker astray. In correctly reducing</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12" name="e12">12.12)</a> mi viska pa nanmu .ije mi viska pa ninmu
       I see a man, and I see a woman.
</pre>
to
<pre>
<a id="e13" name="e13">12.13)</a> mi viska pa nanmu .e pa ninmu
       I see a man and a woman.
</pre>
there is a great temptation to reduce further to:
<pre>
<a id="e14" name="e14">12.14)</a> mi viska pa nanmu je ninmu
       I see a man and woman.
</pre>
But <a href="../12/#e14">Example 12.14</a> means that you see one thing which is both a man and a woman simultaneously! A “nanmu je ninmu” is a manwoman, a presumably non-existent creature who is both a “nanmu” and a “ninmu”.
