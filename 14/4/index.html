          <h3><a id="4" name="4">4. Logical connection of bridi</h3>

    <p>Now we are ready to express <a href="#1-1">Example 1.1</a>
    in Lojban! The kind of logical connective which is placed
    between two Lojban bridi to connect them logically is an
    ijek:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-1"
name="4-1">4.1)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man or James is-a-woman.
</pre>

    <p>Here we have two separate Lojban bridi, ``la djan. nanmu''
    and ``la djeimyz. ninmu''. These bridi are connected by
    ``.ija'', the ijek for the truth function <span
    class="c3">A</span>. The ``.i'' portion of the ijek tells us
    that we are dealing with separate sentences here. Similarly, we
    can now say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-2"
name="4-2">4.2)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ije la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man and James is-a-woman.

<a id="4-3"
name="4-3">4.3)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijo la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="4-4"
name="4-4">4.4)</a>   la djan. nanmu .iju la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man whether-or-not James is-a-woman.
</pre>
    To obtain the other truth tables listed in <a
    href=../2/>Section 2</a>, we need to know how to negate the two
    bridi which represent the component sentences. We could negate
    them directly by inserting ``na'' before the selbri, but Lojban
    also allows us to place the negation within the connective
    itself. 

    <p>To negate the first or left-hand bridi, prefix ``na'' to the
    JA cmavo but after the ``.i''. To negate the second or
    right-hand bridi, suffix ``-nai'' to the JA cmavo. In either
    case, the negating word is placed on the side of the connective
    that is closest to the bridi being negated.</p>

    <p>So to express the truth table FTTF, which requires <span
    class="c3">O</span> with either of the two bridi negated (not
    both), we can say either:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-5"
name="4-5">4.5)</a>  la djan. nanmu .inajo la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="4-6"
name="4-6">4.6)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijonai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman
</pre>

    <p>The meaning of both <a href="#4-5">Example 4.5</a> and <a
    href="#4-6">Example 4.6</a> is the same as that of:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-7"
name="4-7">4.7)</a>  John is a man or James is a woman, but not both.
</pre>

    <p>Here is another example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-8"
name="4-8">4.8)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man or James is-not-a-woman.
    John is a man if James is a woman.
</pre>
    How's that again? Are those two English sentences in <a
    href="#4-8">Example 4.8</a> really equivalent? In English, no.
    The Lojban TTFT truth function can be glossed ``A if B'', but
    the ``if'' does not quite have its English sense. <a
    href="#4-8">Example 4.8</a> is true so long as John is a man,
    even if James is not a woman; likewise, it is true just because
    James is not a woman, regardless of John's gender. This kind of
    ``if-then'' is technically known as a ``material conditional''.
    

    <p>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in <a
    href=../1/>Section 1</a>), the English sentence ``John is a man
    if James is a woman'' seems to be neither true nor false, since
    it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most
    convenient to treat this ``if'' as TTFT, which on investigation
    means that <a href="#4-8">Example 4.8</a> is true. <a
    href="#4-9">Example 4.9</a>, however, is equally true:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-9"
name="4-9">4.9)</a>  la djan. ninmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a woman if James is a woman.
</pre>
    This can be thought of as a principle of consistency, and may
    be paraphrased as follows: ``If a false statement is true, any
    statement follows from it.'' All uses of English ``if'' must be
    considered very carefully when translating into Lojban to see
    if they really fit this Lojban mold. 

    <a href="#4-10">Example 4.10</a>, which uses the TFTT truth
    function, is subject to the same rules: the stated gloss of TFTT as
    ``only if'' works naturally only when the left-hand bridi is true;
    if it is false, the right-hand bridi may be either true or false.
    The last gloss of <a href="#4-10">Example 4.10</a> illustrates the
    use of ``if ... then'' as a more natural substitute for ``only
    if''.</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-10"
name="4-10">4.10)</a>    la djan. nanmu .inaja la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man or James is-a-woman.
    John is a man only if James is a woman.
    If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre>
    The following example illustrates the use of ``se'' to, in
    effect, exchange the two sentences. The normal use of ``se'' is
    to (in effect) tranpose places of a bridi, as explained in <a
    href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>. 
<pre>
<a id="4-11"
name="4-11">4.11)</a>    la djan. nanmu .iseju la djeimyz. ninmu
    Whether or not John is a man, James is a woman.
</pre>
    If both ``na'' and ``se'' are present, which is legal but never
    necessary, ``na'' would come before ``se''. 

    <p>The full syntax of ijeks, therefore, is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>.i [na] [se] JA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
    where the cmavo in brackets are optional.
