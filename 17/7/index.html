          <h3>7. Punctuation marks</h3>

    <p>Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu
    and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other
    languages, however, use punctuation marks extensively. As yet,
    Lojban does not have any words for these punctuation marks, but
    a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo “lau” of
    selma'o LAU. “lau” must always be followed by a BY word; the
    interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a
    punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a name or
    brivla with a “bu” suffix.</p>

    <p>Why is “lau” necessary at all? Why not just use a
    “bu”-marked word and announce that it is always to be
    interpreted as a punctuation mark? Primarily to avoid
    ambiguity. The “bu” mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it
    is easy for Lojban users to make up “bu” words without
    bothering to explain what they mean. Using the “lau” cmavo
    flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as
    having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same
    argument applies to the use of “zai” to signal an alphabet
    shift or “ce'a” to signal a font shift.)</p>

    <p>Since different alphabets require different punctuation
    marks, the interpretation of a “lau”-marked lerfu word is
    affected by the current alphabet shift and the current font
    shift.</p>
