          <h3>5. Alien alphabets</h3>

    <p>As stated in <a href=../1/>Section 1</a>, Lojban’s goal of
    cultural neutrality demands a standard set of lerfu words for
    the lerfu of as many other writing systems as possible. When we
    meet these lerfu in written text (particularly, though not
    exclusively, mathematical text), we need a standard Lojbanic
    way to pronounce them.</p>

    <p>There are certainly hundreds of alphabets and other writing
    systems in use around the world, and it is probably an
    unachievable goal to create a single system which can express
    all of them, but if perfection is not demanded, a usable system
    can be created from the raw material which Lojban provides.</p>

    <p>One possibility would be to use the lerfu word associated
    with the language itself, Lojbanized and with “bu” added.
    Indeed, an isolated Greek “alpha” in running Lojban text is
    probably most easily handled by calling it “.alfas. bu”. Here
    the Greek lerfu word has been made into a Lojbanized name by
    adding “s” and then into a Lojban lerfu word by adding
    “bu”. Note that the pause after “.alfas.” is still
    needed.</p>

    <p>Likewise, the easiest way to handle the Latin letters “h”,
    “q”, and “w” that are not used in Lojban is by a consonant
    lerfu word with “bu” attached. The following assignments have
    been made:</p>
<pre>
       .y'y.bu     h
        ky.bu       q
        vy.bu       w
</pre>
    As an example, the English word “quack” would be spelled in
    Lojban thus: 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>  ky.bu .ubu .abu cy. ky.
    “q” “u” “a” “c” “k”
</pre>
    Note that the fact that the letter “c” in this word has
    nothing to do with the sound of the Lojban letter “c” is
    irrelevant; we are spelling an English word and English rules
    control the choice of letters, but we are speaking Lojban and
    Lojban rules control the pronunciations of those letters. 

    <p>A few more possibilities for Latin-alphabet letters used in
    languages other than English:</p>
<pre>
       ty.bu       &thorn; (thorn)
        dy.bu       &amp;edh; (edh)
        

However, this system is not ideal for all purposes.  For one thing, it is
verbose.  The native lerfu words are often quite long, and with “bu” added
they become even longer: the worst-case Greek lerfu word would be
“.Omikron. bu”, with four syllables and two mandatory pauses.  In addition,
alphabets that are used by many languages have separate sets of lerfu words
for each language, and which set is Lojban to choose?
</pre>
    The alternative plan, therefore, is to use a shift word similar
    to those introduced in <a href=../3/>Section 3</a>. After the
    appearance of such a shift word, the regular lerfu words are
    re-interpreted to represent the lerfu of the alphabet now in
    use. After a shift to the Greek alphabet, for example, the
    lerfu word “ty” would represent not Latin “t” but Greek
    “tau”. Why “tau”? Because it is, in some sense, the closest
    counterpart of “t” within the Greek lerfu system. In
    principle it would be all right to map “ty.” to “phi” or
    even “omega”, but such an arbitrary relationship would be
    extremely hard to remember. 

    <p>Where no obvious closest counterpart exists, some more or
    less arbitrary choice must be made. Some alien lerfu may simply
    not have any shifted equivalent, forcing the speaker to fall
    back on a “bu” form. Since a “bu” form may mean different
    things in different alphabets, it is safest to employ a shift
    word even when “bu” forms are in use.</p>

    <p>Shifts for several alphabets have been assigned cmavo of
    selma'o BY:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   lo'a    Latin/Roman/Lojban alphabet
    ge'o    Greek alphabet
    je'o    Hebrew alphabet
    jo'o    Arabic alphabet
    ru'o    Cyrillic alphabet
</pre>
    The cmavo “zai” (of selma'o LAU) is used to create shift
    words to still other alphabets. The BY word which must follow
    any LAU cmavo would typically be a name representing the
    alphabet with “bu” suffixed: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>  zai .devanagar. bu
    Devanagari (Hindi) alphabet
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>  zai .katakan. bu
    Japanese katakana syllabary
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">5.4)</a>  zai .xiragan. bu
    Japanese hiragana syllabary
</pre>
    Unlike the cmavo above, these shift words have not been
    standardized and probably will not be until someone actually
    has a need for them. (Note the “.” characters marking leading
    and following pauses.) 

    <p>In addition, there may be multiple visible representations
    within a single alphabet for a given letter: roman vs. italics,
    handwriting vs. print, Bodoni vs. Helvetica. These traditional
    “font and face” distinctions are also represented by shift
    words, indicated with the cmavo “ce'a” (of selma'o LAU) and a
    following BY word:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>  ce'a .xelveticas. bu
    Helvetica font
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">5.6)</a>  ce'a .xancisk. bu
    handwriting
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">5.7)</a>  ce'a .pavrel. bu
    12-point font size
</pre>
    The cmavo “na'a” (of selma'o BY) is a universal shift-word
    cancel: it returns the interpretation of lerfu words to the
    default of lower-case Lojban with no specific font. It is more
    general than “lo'a”, which changes the alphabet only,
    potentially leaving font and case shifts in place. 

    <p>Several sections at the end of this chapter contain tables
    of proposed lerfu word assignments for various languages.</p>
