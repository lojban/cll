          <h3>2. A to Z in Lojban, plus one</h3>

    <p>The first requirement of a system of lerfu words for any
    language is that they must represent the lerfu used to write
    the language. The lerfu words for English are a motley crew:
    the relationship between “doubleyou” and “w” is strictly
    historical in nature; “aitch” represents “h” but has no
    clear relationship to it at all; and “z” has two distinct
    lerfu words, “zee” and “zed”, depending on the dialect of
    English in question.</p>

    <p>All of Lojban's basic lerfu words are made by one of three
    rules:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>to get a lerfu word for a vowel, add “bu”; to get a
      lerfu word for a consonant, add “y”; the lerfu word for
      “”' is “.y'y”.</dd>
    </dl>
    Therefore, the following table represents the basic Lojban
    alphabet: 
<pre>
   '   a   b   c   d   e
    .y'y.   .abu    by. cy. dy. .ebu

    f   g   i   j   k   l
    fy. gy. .ibu    jy. ky. ly.

    m   n   o   p   r   s
    my. ny. .obu    py. ry. sy.

    t   u   v   x   y   z
    ty. .ubu    vy. xy. .ybu    zy.
</pre>
    There are several things to note about this table. The
    consonant lerfu words are a single syllable, whereas the vowel
    and “”' lerfu words are two syllables and must be preceded by
    pause (since they all begin with a vowel). Another fact, not
    evident from the table but important nonetheless, is that
    “by” and its like are single cmavo of selma'o BY, as is
    “.y'y”. The vowel lerfu words, on the other hand, are
    compound cmavo, made from a single vowel cmavo plus the cmavo
    “bu” (which belongs to its own selma'o, BU). All of the vowel
    cmavo have other meanings in Lojban (logical connectives,
    sentence separator, hesitation noise), but those meanings are
    irrelevant when “bu” follows. 

    <p>Here are some illustrations of common Lojban words spelled
    out using the alphabet above:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  ty. .abu ny. ry. .ubu
    “t” “a” “n” “r” “u”

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   ky. .obu .y'y. .abu
    “k” “o” “”' “a”
</pre>
    Spelling out words is less useful in Lojban than in English,
    for two reasons: Lojban spelling is phonemic, so there can be
    no real dispute about how a word is spelled; and the Lojban
    lerfu words sound more alike than the English ones do, since
    they are made up systematically. The English words “fail” and
    “vale” sound similar, but just hearing the first lerfu word
    of either, namely “eff” or “vee”, is enough to discriminate
    easily between them --- and even if the first lerfu word were
    somehow confused, neither “vail” nor “fale” is a word of
    ordinary English, so the rest of the spelling determines which
    word is meant. Still, the capability of spelling out words does
    exist in Lojban. 

    <p>Note that the lerfu words ending in “y” were written (in
    <a href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a> and <a href="../2/#2">Example
    2.2</a>) with pauses after them. It is not strictly necessary
    to pause after such lerfu words, but failure to do so can in
    some cases lead to ambiguities:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>  mi cy. claxu
    I lerfu-“c” without
    I am without (whatever is referred to by)
        the letter “c”.
</pre>
    without a pause after “cy” would be interpreted as: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>  micyclaxu
    (Observative:) doctor-without
    Something unspecified is without a doctor.
</pre>

    <p>A safe guideline is to pause after any cmavo ending in “y”
    unless the next word is also a cmavo ending in “y”. The
    safest and easiest guideline is to pause after all of them.</p>
