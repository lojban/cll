          <h3>9. lerfu words as pro-sumti</h3>

    <p>So far, lerfu words have only appeared in Lojban text when
    spelling out words. There are several other grammatical uses of
    lerfu words within Lojban. In each case, a single lerfu word or
    more than one may be used. Therefore, the term “lerfu string”
    is introduced: it is short for “sequence of one or more lerfu
    words”.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string may be used as a pro-sumti (a sumti which
    refers to some previous sumti), just like the pro-sumti
    “ko'a”, “ko'e”, and so on:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>   .abu prami by.
       A loves B
</pre>

    In <a href="../9/#1">Example 9.1</a>, “.abu” and “by.”
    represent specific sumti, but which sumti they represent must
    be inferred from context.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, lerfu strings may be assigned by “goi”, the
    regular pro-sumti assignment cmavo:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>   le gerku goi gy. cu xekri .i gy. klama le zdani
       The dog, or G, is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>

    There is a special rule that sometimes makes lerfu strings more
    advantageous than the regular pro-sumti cmavo. If no assignment
    can be found for a lerfu string (especially a single lerfu
    word), it can be assumed to refer to the most recent sumti
    whose name or description begins in Lojban with that lerfu. So
    <a href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a> can be rephrased: 

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>   le gerku cu xekri. .i gy. klama le zdani
       The dog is black. G goes to the house.
</pre>

    (A less literal English translation would use “D” for “dog”
    instead.)</p>

    <p>Here is an example using two names and longer lerfu
    strings:

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>   la stivn. mark. djonz. merko
            .i la .aleksandr. paliitc. kuzNIETsyf. rusko
            .i symyjy. tavla .abupyky. bau la lojban.
       Steven Mark Jones is-American.
            Alexander Pavlovitch Kuznetsov is-Russian.
            SMJ talks-to APK in Lojban.
</pre>

    <p>Perhaps Alexander’s name should be given as “ru'o.abupyky”
    instead.</p>

    <p>What about

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>   .abu dunda by. cy.
       A gives B C
</pre>

    Does this mean that A gives B to C? No. “by. cy.” is a single
    lerfu string, although written as two words, and represents a
    single pro-sumti. The true interpretation is that A gives BC to
    someone unspecified. To solve this problem, we need to
    introduce the elidable terminator “boi” (of selma'o BOI).
    This cmavo is used to terminate lerfu strings and also strings
    of numerals; it is required when two of these appear in a row,
    as here. (The other reason to use “boi” is to attach a free
    modifier &mdash; subscript, parenthesis, or what have you &mdash; to a
    lerfu string.) The correct version is: 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>   .abu [boi] dunda by. boi cy. [boi]
       A gives B to C
</pre>

    where the two occurrences of “boi” in brackets are elidable,
    but the remaining occurrence is not. Likewise: 

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>   xy. boi ro [boi] prenu cu prami
       X all persons loves.
       X loves everybody.
</pre>

    requires the first “boi” to separate the lerfu string “xy.”
    from the digit string “ro”.</p>
