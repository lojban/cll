          <h3>13. Computerized character codes</h3>

    <p>Since the first application of computers to non-numerical
    information, character sets have existed, mapping numbers
    (called “character codes”) into selected lerfu, digits, and
    punctuation marks (collectively called “characters”).
    Historically, these character sets have only covered the
    English alphabet and a few selected punctuation marks.
    International efforts are now underway to create a unified
    character set that can represent essentially all the characters
    in essentially all the world's writing systems. Lojban can take
    advantage of these encoding schemes by using the cmavo “se'e”
    (of selma'o BY). This cmavo is conventionally followed by digit
    cmavo of selma'o PA representing the character code, and the
    whole string indicates a single character in some computerized
    character set:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">13.1)</a>    me'o se'ecixa cu lerfu
        la .asycy'i'is. loi merko rupnu
    the-expression [code] 36 is-a-letteral
        in-set ASCII
        for-the-mass-of American currency-units.
    The character code 36 in ASCII represents
        American dollars.
    “&amp;dollar;” represents American dollars.
</pre>
    Understanding <a href="../13/#1">Example 13.1</a> depends on
    knowing the value in the ASCII character set (one of the
    simplest and oldest) of the “&amp;dollar;” character.
    Therefore, the “se'e” convention is only intelligible to
    those who know the underlying character set. For precisely
    specifying a particular character, however, it has the
    advantages of unambiguity and (relative) cultural neutrality,
    and therefore Lojban provides a means for those with access to
    descriptions of such character sets to take advantage of them. 

    <p>As another example, the Unicode character set (also known as
    ISO 10646) represents the international symbol of peace, an
    inverted trident in a circle, using the base-16 value 262E. In
    a suitable context, a Lojbanist may say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="13-2"
name="13-2">13.2)</a>    me'o se'erexarerei sinxa le ka panpi
    the-expression [code] 262E is-a-sign-of
        the quality-of being-at-peace
</pre>
    When a “se'e” string appears in running discourse, some
    metalinguistic convention must specify whether the number is
    base 10 (as above) or some other base, and which character set
    is in use.
