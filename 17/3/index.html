          <h3>3. Upper and lower cases</h3>

    <p>Lojban doesn’t use lower-case (small) letters and upper-case
    (capital) letters in the same way that English does; sentences
    do not begin with an upper-case letter, nor do names. However,
    upper-case letters are used in Lojban to mark irregular stress
    within names, thus:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">3.1)</a>   .iVAN.
       the name “Ivan” in Russian/Slavic pronunciation.
</pre>

    It would require far too many cmavo to assign one for each
    upper-case and one for each lower-case lerfu, so instead we
    have two special cmavo “ga'e” and “to'a” representing upper
    case and lower case respectively. They belong to the same
    selma'o as the basic lerfu words, namely BY, and they may be
    freely interspersed with them.</p>

    <p>The effect of “ga'e” is to change the interpretation of
    all lerfu words following it to be the upper-case version of
    the lerfu. An occurrence of “to'a” causes the interpretation
    to revert to lower case. Thus, “ga'e .abu” means not “a”
    but “A”, and Ivan’s name may be spelled out thus:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>   .ibu ga'e vy. .abu ny. to'a
       i [upper] V A N [lower]
</pre>

    The cmavo and compound cmavo of this type will be called
    “shift words”.</p>

    <p>How long does a shift word last? Theoretically, until the
    next shift word that contradicts it or until the end of text.
    In practice, it is common to presume that a shift word is only
    in effect until the next word other than a lerfu word is
    found.</p>

    <p>It is often convenient to shift just a single letter to
    upper case. The cmavo “tau”, of selma'o LAU, is useful for
    the purpose. A LAU cmavo must always be immediately followed by
    a BY cmavo or its equivalent: the combination is grammatically
    equivalent to a single BY. (See <a href=../14/>Section 14</a>
    for details.)</p>

    <p>A likely use of “tau” is in the internationally
    standardized symbols for the chemical elements. Each element is
    represented using either a single upper-case lerfu or one
    upper-case lerfu followed by one lower-case lerfu:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>   tau sy.
       [single shift] S
       S (chemical symbol for sulfur)

<a id="4" name="4">3.4)</a>   tau sy. .ibu
       [single shift] S i
       Si (chemical symbol for silicon)
</pre>

    If a shift to upper-case is in effect when “tau” appears, it
    shifts the next lerfu word only to lower case, reversing its
    usual effect.</p>
