          <h3>15. Proposed lerfu words --- introduction</h3>

    <p>The following sections contain tables of proposed lerfu
    words for some of the standard alphabets supported by the
    Lojban lerfu system. The first column of each list is the lerfu
    (actually, a Latin-alphabet name sufficient to identify it).
    The second column is the proposed name-based lerfu word, and
    the third column is the proposed lerfu word in the system based
    on using the cmavo of selma'o BY with a shift word.</p>

    <p>These tables are not meant to be authoritative (several
    authorities within the Lojban community have niggled over them
    extensively, disagreeing with each other and sometimes with
    themselves). They provide a working basis until actual usage is
    available, rather than a final resolution of lerfu word
    problems. Probably the system presented here will evolve
    somewhat before settling down into a final, conventional
    form.</p>

    <p>For Latin-alphabet lerfu words, see <a href=../2/>Section
    2</a> (for Lojban) and <a href=../5/>Section 5</a> (for
    non-Lojban Latin-alphabet lerfu).</p>
