<h3>10. bridi negation and logical connectives</h3>
<p>A complete discussion of logical connectives appears in <a href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a>. What is said here is intentionally quite incomplete and makes several oversimplifications.</p>
<p>A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this chapter, we will make use of the logical connectives “and” and “or” (where “or” really means “and/or”, “either or both”). The following simplified recipes explain how to make some logical connectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “and”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo “.e”.</li>
<li>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “and”, replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound cmavo “.ije”.</li>
<li>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “or”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo “.a”.</li>
<li>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “or”, replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound cmavo “.ija”.</li>
</ul>
<p>More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular, one may place “na” before “.e” or “.a”, or between “.i” and “je” or “ja”; likewise, one may place “nai” at the end of a connective. Both “na” and “nai” have negative effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically, “na” negates the first or left-hand sumti or bridi, and “nai” negates the second or right-hand one.</p>
<p>Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that sentence can be expanded into two sentences by repeating the common terms and joining the sentences by a logical connective beginning with “.i”. Thus the following sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">10.1)</a>  mi .e do klama ti
       I and you come here.
</pre>
can be expanded to:
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">10.2)</a>  mi klama ti .ije do klama ti
       I come here, and, you come here.
</pre>
<p>The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical connective, with any valid combination of “na” or “nai” attached. No change in meaning occurs under such a transformation.</p>
<p>Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded sentence forms, then we know what it means in all of the other forms. But what does negation mean between sentences?</p>
<p>The mystery is easily solved. A negation in a logical expression is identical to the corresponding bridi negation, with the negator placed at the beginning of the prenex. Thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">10.3)</a>  mi .enai do prami roda
       I, and not you, love everything.
</pre>
expands to:
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">10.4)</a>  mi prami roda .ijenai do prami roda
       I love everything, and-not, you love everything.
</pre>
and then into prenex form as:
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">10.5)</a>  roda zo'u mi prami da .ije naku zo'u do prami da
       For each thing: I love it, and it is false that you love (the same) it.
</pre>
<p>By the rules of predicate logic, the “ro” quantifier on “da” has scope over both sentences. That is, once you’ve picked a value for “da” for the first sentence, it stays the same for both sentences. (The “da” continues with the same fixed value until a new paragraph or a new prenex resets the meaning.)</p>
<p>Thus the following example has the indicated translation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6" name="e6">10.6)</a>  su'oda zo'u mi prami da
            .ije naku zo'u do prami da
       For at least one thing: I love that thing.
            And it is false that: you love that (same) thing.
       There is something that I love that you don’t.
</pre>
<p>If you remember only two rules for prenex manipulation of negations, you won’t go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within a prenex, whenever you move “naku” past a bound variable (da, de, di, etc.), you must invert the quantifier.</li>
<li>A “na” before the selbri is always transformed into a “naku” at the left-hand end of the prenex, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
