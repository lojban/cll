          <h3>8. The problem of “any”</h3>

    <p>Consider the English sentence</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-1"
name="8-1">8.1)</a>  Anyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.
</pre>

    <p>Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible
    translation might be</p>
<pre>
<a id="8-2"
name="8-2">8.2)</a>  ro da poi klama le zarci cu cadzu le foldi
    All X such-that-it goes-to the store walks-on the field.
    Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.
</pre>
    But there is a subtle difference between <a
    href="../8/#1">Example 8.1</a> and <a href="../8/#2">Example
    8.2</a>. <a href="../8/#2">Example 8.2</a> tells us that, in
    fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk
    across the field. A sumti of the type “ro da poi klama”
    requires that there are things which “klama”: Lojban
    universal claims always imply the corresponding existential
    claims as well. <a href="../8/#1">Example 8.1</a>, on the other
    hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the
    store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone
    who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as
    well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation
    of <a href="../8/#1">Example 8.1</a>: 
<pre>
<a id="8-3"
name="8-3">8.3)</a>  ro da zo'u ganai da klama le zarci
        gi cadzu le foldi
    For-every X: if X is-a-goer-to the store
        then X is-a-walker-on the field.
</pre>
    Although <a href="../8/#3">Example 8.3</a> is a universal claim
    as well, its universality only implies that there are objects
    of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because
    the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the
    existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field,
    merely that any entity which is one is also the other. 

    <p>There is another use of “any” in English that is not
    universal but existential. Consider</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-4"
name="8-4">8.4)</a>  I need any box that is bigger than this one.
</pre>
    <a href="../8/#4">Example 8.4</a> does not at all mean that I
    need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I
    require only one box. But the naive translation 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">8.5)</a>  mi nitcu da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti
    I need some-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this-one
</pre>
    does not work either, because it asserts that there really is
    such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates: 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">8.6)</a>  da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti zo'u mi nitcu da
    There-is-an-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this : I need X.
</pre>

    <p>What to do? Well, the x2 place of “nitcu” can be filled
    with an event as well as an object, and in fact <a
    href="../8/#5">Example 8.5</a> can also be paraphrased as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">8.7)</a>  mi nitcu lo nu mi ponse
        lo tanxe poi bramau ti
    I need an event-of I possess
        some box(es) which-are bigger-than this-one.
</pre>

    <p>Rewritten using variables, <a href="../8/#7">Example 8.7</a>
    becomes</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">8.8)</a>  mi nitcu lo nu da zo'u
        da se ponse mi gi'e tanxe
            gi'e bramau ti
    I need an event-of there-being an-X such-that
        X is-possessed-by me and is-a-box
            and is-bigger-than this-thing.
</pre>
    So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is
    within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if
    it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the
    smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond
    that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer
    prenex explicitly: 
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">8.9)</a>  da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti zo'u
        mi nitcu le nu mi ponse da
    There-is-an-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this-one such-that
        I need the event-of my possessing X.
</pre>
    But what are the implications of <a href="../8/#7">Example
    8.7</a> and <a href="../8/#9">Example 8.9</a>? The main
    difference is that in <a href="../8/#9">Example 8.9</a>, the
    “da” is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi;
    but in <a href="../8/#7">Example 8.7</a>, the existence is only
    within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not
    necessarily come to pass. So <a href="../8/#9">Example 8.9</a>
    means 
<pre>
<a id="8-10"
name="8-10">8.10)</a>    There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
</pre>
    which is what <a href="../8/#6">Example 8.6</a> says, whereas <a
    href="../8/#7">Example 8.7</a> turns out to be an effective
    translation of our original <a href="../8/#1">Example 8.1</a>. So
    uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by
    variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.
