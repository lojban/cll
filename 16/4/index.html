          <h3>4. Restricted claims: “da poi”</h3>

    <p>The universal claims of <a href=../3/>Section 3</a> are not
    only false but absurd: there is really very little to be said
    that is both true and non-trivial about every object
    whatsoever. Furthermore, we have been glossing over the
    distinction between “everything” and “everybody” and the
    other pairs ending in “-thing” and “-body”. It is time to
    bring up the most useful feature of Lojban variables: the
    ability to restrict their ranges.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, a variable “da”, “de”, or “di” may be
    followed by a “poi” relative clause in order to restrict the
    range of things that the variable describes. Relative clauses
    are described in detail in <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>,
    but the kind we will need at present consist of “poi”
    followed by a bridi (often just a selbri) terminated with
    “ku'o” or “vau” (which can usually be elided). Consider the
    difference between</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  da zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X : X sees Jim.
    Something sees Jim.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="4-2"
name="4-2">4.2)</a>  da poi prenu zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X which is-a-person : X sees Jim.
    Someone sees Jim.
</pre>
    In <a href="../4/#1">Example 4.1</a>, the variable “da” can
    refer to any object whatever; there are no restrictions on it.
    In <a href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a>, “da” is restricted by the
    “poi prenu” relative clause to persons only, and so “da poi
    prenu” translates as “someone.” (The difference between
    “someone” and “somebody” is a matter of English style, with
    no real counterpart in Lojban.) If <a href="../4/#2">Example
    4.2</a> is true, then <a href="../4/#1">Example 4.1</a> must be
    true, but not necessarily vice versa. 

    <p>Universal claims benefit even more from the existence of
    relative clauses. Consider</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>  ro da zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X : X breathes
    Everything breathes
</pre>
    and 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  ro da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X which is-a-dog : X breathes.
    Every dog breathes.
    Each dog breathes.
    All dogs breathe.
</pre>
    <a href="../4/#3">Example 4.3</a> is a silly falsehood, but <a
    href="../4/#4">Example 4.4</a> is an important truth (at least if
    applied in a timeless or potential sense: see <a
    href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>). Note the various colloquial
    translations “every dog”, “each dog”, and “all dogs”.
    They all come to the same thing in Lojban, since what is true
    of every dog is true of all dogs. “All dogs” is treated as an
    English plural and the others as singular, but Lojban makes no
    distinction. 

    <p>If we make an existential claim about dogs rather than a
    universal one, we get:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">4.5)</a>  da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    There-is-an-X which is-a-dog : X breathes.
    Some dog breathes.
</pre>
