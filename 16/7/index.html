          <h3><a id="7" name="7">7. Grouping of quantifiers</h3>

    <p>Let us consider a sentence containing two quantifier
    expressions neither of which is ``ro'' or ``su'o'' (remembering
    that ``su'o'' is implicit where no explicit quantifier is
    given):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  ci gerku cu batci re nanmu
    Three dogs bite two men.
</pre>
    The question raised by <a href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a> is, does
    each of the dogs bite the same two men, or is it possible that
    there are two different men per dog, for six men altogether? If
    the former interpretation is taken, the number of men involved
    is fixed at two; but if the latter, then the speaker has to be
    taken as saying that there might be any number of men between
    two and six inclusive. Let us transform <a href="../7/#1">Example
    7.1</a> step by step as we did with <a href="../6/#6">Example
    6.6</a>: 
<pre>
<a id="7-2"
name="7-2">7.2)</a>  ci da poi gerku cu batci re de poi nanmu
    Three Xes which are-dogs bite two Ys which are-men.
</pre>
    (Note that we need separate variables ``da'' and ``de'',
    because of the rule that says each indefinite description gets
    a variable never used before or since.) 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>  ci da poi gerku ku'o
        re de poi nanmu zo'u
            da batci de
    For-three Xes which are-dogs,
        for-two Ys which are-men :
            X bites Y.
</pre>

    <p>Here we see that indeed each of the dogs is said to bite two
    men, and it might be different men each time; a total of six
    biting events altogether.</p>

    <p>How then are we to express the other interpretation, in
    which just two men are involved? We cannot just reverse the
    order of variables in the prenex to</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">7.4)</a>  re de poi nanmu ku'o
        ci da poi gerku zo'u da batci de
    For-two Ys which are-men,
        for-three Xes which are-dogs, X bites Y
</pre>
    for although we have now limited the number of men to exactly
    two, we end up with an indeterminate number of dogs, from three
    to six. The distinction is called a ``scope distinction'': in
    <a href="../7/#2">Example 7.2</a>, ``ci gerku'' is said to have
    wider scope than ``re nanmu'', and therefore precedes it in the
    prenex. In <a href="../7/#4">Example 7.4</a> the reverse is true.
    

    <p>The solution is to use a termset, which is a group of terms
    either joined by ``ce'e'' (of selma'o CEhE) between each term,
    or else surrounded by ``nu'i'' (of selma'o NUhI) on the front
    and ``nu'u'' (of selma'o NUhU) on the rear. Terms (which are
    either sumti or sumti prefixed by tense or modal tags) that are
    grouped into a termset are understood to have equal scope:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">7.5)</a>  ci gerku ce'e re nanmu cu batci
    nu'i ci gerku re nanmu [nu'u] cu batci
    Three dogs [plus] two men, bite.
</pre>
    which picks out two groups, one of three dogs and the other of
    two men, and says that every one of the dogs bites each of the
    men. The second Lojban version uses forethought; note that
    ``nu'u'' is an elidable terminator, and in this case can be
    freely elided. 

    <p>What about descriptors, like ``ci lo gerku'', ``le nanmu''
    or ``re le ci mlatu''? They too can be grouped in termsets, but
    usually need not be, except for the ``lo'' case which functions
    like the case without a descriptor. Unless an actual quantifier
    precedes it, ``le nanmu'' means ``ro le nanmu'', as is
    explained in <a href="../../6/1/">Chapter 6</a>. Two sumti with
    ``ro'' quantifiers are independent of order, so:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7-6"
name="7-6">7.6)</a>  [ro] le ci gerku cu batci [ro] le re nanmu
    [All of] the three dogs bite [all of] the two men.
</pre>
    means that each of the dogs specified bites each of the men
    specified, for six acts of biting altogether. However, if there
    is an explicit quantifier before ``le'' other than ``ro'', the
    problems of this section reappear.
