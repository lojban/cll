          <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. Utterance ordinals: MAI</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   mai MAI utterance ordinal, -thly
    mo'o    MAI higher order utterance ordinal
</pre>
    Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English ``firstly'',
    ``secondly'', and so on, can be created by suffixing ``mai'' or
    ``mo'o'' of selma'o MAI to a number or a lerfu string. Here are
    some examples: 
<pre>
<a id="e7d1"
name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi klama pamai le zarci .e remai le zdani
    I go-to (firstly) the store and (secondly) the market.
</pre>

    <p>This does not imply that I go to the store before I go to
    the market: that meaning requires a tense. The sumti are simply
    numbered for convenience of reference. Like other free
    modifiers, the utterance ordinals can be inserted almost
    anywhere in a sentence without affecting its grammar or its
    meaning.</p>

    <p>Any of the Lojban numbers can be used with MAI: ``romai'',
    for example, means ``all-thly'' or ``lastly''. Likewise, if you
    are enumerating a long list and have forgotten which number is
    wanted next, you can say ``ny.mai'', or ``Nthly''.</p>

    <p>The difference between ``mai'' and ``mo'o'' is that ``mo'o''
    enumerates larger subdivisions of a text; ``mai'' was designed
    for lists of numbered items, whereas ``mo'o'' was intended to
    subdivide structured works. If this chapter were translated
    into Lojban, it might number each section with ``mo'o'': this
    section would then be introduced with ``zemo'o'', or ``<a
    href="s7.html">Section 7</a>.''</p>
