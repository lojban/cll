    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   xu  UI  truth question
    ma  KOhA    sumti question
    mo  GOhA    bridi question
    xo  PA  number question
    ji  A   sumti connective question

</pre>
    Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There
    are two basic types: truth questions, of the form ``Is it true
    that ... '', and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions
    are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it
    specifically questioned, with the cmavo ``xu'' (of selma'o UI):
    
<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  xu do klama le zarci
    [True or false?] You go to the store
    Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?
</pre>
    (Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation
    might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in <a
    href="../c15/s1.html">Chapter 15</a>. 

    <p>Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some
    Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and
    which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo
    belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of
    blanks.</p>

    <p>Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with
    ``ma'' (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  ma klama le zarci
    [What sumti?] goes-to the store
    Who is going to the store?
</pre>

    <p>Of course, the ``ma'' need not be in the x1 place:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  do klama ma
    You go-to [what sumti?]
    Where are you going?
</pre>

    <p>The answer is a simple sumti:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  le zarci
    The store.
</pre>

    <p>A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by
    itself constitute a bridi -- it does not claim anything, but
    merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous
    bridi.</p>

    <p>There can be two ``ma'' cmavo in a single question:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ma klama ma
    Who goes where?
</pre>
    and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in
    the two ``ma'' cmavo in order: 
<pre>
<a id="e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  mi le zarci
    I, to the store.
</pre>
    An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical
    connective ``fa'u'' (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English
    ``and ... respectively'': 
<pre>
<a id="e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ma fa'u ma klama ma fa'u ma
    Who and who goes where and where, respectively?
</pre>

    <p>An answer might be</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d8"
name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  la djan. la marcas. le zarci le briju
    John, Marsha, the store, the office.
    John and Marsha go to the store and the office,
        respectively.
</pre>
    (Note: A mechanical substitution of <a href="#e5d8">Example
    5.8</a> into <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a> produces an
    ungrammatical result, because ``* ... le zarci fa'u le briju''
    is ungrammatical Lojban: the first ``le zarci'' has to be
    closed with its proper terminator ``ku'', for reasons explained
    in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>. This effect is not
    important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have
    been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the
    latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question
    and answer are each separately grammatical.) 

    <p>Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with
    ``mo'' of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  la lojban. mo
    Lojban [what selbri?]
    What is Lojban?
</pre>
    Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of
    Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the
    enormous range of possible predicate answers. The answer might
    be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the
    sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner.
    To limit the range of a ``mo'' question, make it part of a
    tanru. 

    <p>Questions about numbers are expressed with ``xo'' of selma'o
    PA:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d10" name="e5d10">5.10)</a>    do viska xo prenu
    You saw [what number?] persons.
    How many people did you see?
</pre>

    <p>The answer would be a simple number, another kind of
    non-bridi utterance:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d11" name="e5d11">5.11)</a>    vomu
    Forty-five.
</pre>

    <p>Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical
    connectives (using cmavo ``ji'' of A, ``ge'i'' of GA, ``gi'i''
    of GIhA, ``gu'i'' of GUhA, or ``je'i'' of JA, and receiving an
    ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) --- see <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>; attitudes (using ``pei'' of
    UI, and receiving an attitudinal as an answer) --- see <a
    href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>; place structures (using
    ``fi'a'' of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) ---
    see <a href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>; tenses and modals
    (using ``cu'e'' of CUhE, and receiving any tense or BAI cmavo
    as an answer) --- see <a href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a> and <a
    href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

    <p>Questions can be marked by placing ``pau'' (of selma'o UI)
    before the question bridi. See <a href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter
    13</a> for details.</p>

    <p>The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to
    questions is:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>any number of sumti (with elidable terminator ``vau'',
      see <a href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>) an ek or gihek
      (logical connectives, see <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter
      14</a>) a number, or any mathematical expression placed in
      parentheses (see <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>) a bare
      ``na'' negator (to negate some previously expressed bridi),
      or corresponding ``ja'a'' affirmer (see <a
      href="../c15/s1.html">Chapter 15</a>) a relative clause (to
      modify some previously expressed sumti, see <a
      href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>) a prenex/topic (to modify
      some previously expressed bridi, see <a
      href="../c16/s1.html">Chapter 16</a>) linked arguments
      (beginning with ``be'' or ``bei'' and attached to some
      previously expressed selbri, often in a description,see <a
      href="../c5/s1.html">Chapter 5</a>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also
    permitted:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>one or more names (to indicate direct address without
      ``doi'', see <a href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>) indicators
      (to express a prevailing attitude, see <a
      href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>) ``nai'' (to vaguely negate
      something or other, see <a href="../c15/s1.html">Chapter
      15</a>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of
    these are made grammatical for pragmatic reasons: people will
    say them in conversation, and there is no reason to rule them
    out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.</p>
