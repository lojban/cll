    <h3><a id="s17" name="s17">17. Logical and non-logical connectives within mekso</h3>

    <p>Lojban has a separate grammar embedded within the main
    grammar for representing mathematical expressions (or mekso in
    Lojban) such as ``2 + 2''. Mathematical expressions are
    explained fully in <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>. The
    basic components of mekso are operands, like ``2'', and
    operators, like ``+''. Both of these may be either logically or
    non-logically connected.</p>

    <p>Operands are connected in afterthought with eks and in
    forethought with geks, just like sumti. Operators, on the other
    hand, are connected in afterthought with jeks and in
    forethought with guheks, just like tanru components. (However,
    jeks and joiks with ``bo'' are not allowed for operators.) This
    parallelism is no accident.</p>

    <p>In addition, eks with ``bo'' and with ``ke ... ke'e'' are
    allowed for grouping logically connected operands, and ``ke ...
    ke'e'' is allowed for grouping logically connected operators,
    although there is no analogue of tanru among the operators.</p>

    <p>Only a few examples of each kind of mekso connection will be
    given. Despite the large number of rules required to support
    this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in either
    the mekso or the logical-connective scheme of things. These
    examples are drawn from <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>,
    and contain many mekso features not explained in this
    chapter.</p>

    <p><a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> exhibits afterthought
    logical connection between operands:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d1"
name="e17d1">17.1)</a>    vei ci .a vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( three or four ) people go-to the market.
</pre>
    <a href="#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> is equivalent in meaning, but
    uses forethought connection: 
<pre>
<a id="e17d2"
name="e17d2">17.2)</a>    vei ga ci gi vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( either 3 or 4 ) people go-to the market.
</pre>
    Note that the mekso in <a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> and <a
    href="#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> are being used as quantifiers.
    Lojban requires that any mekso other than a simple number be
    enclosed in ``vei'' and ``ve'o'' parentheses when used as a
    quantifier. The right parenthesis mark, ``ve'o'', is an
    elidable terminator. 

    <p>Simple examples of logical connection between operators are
    hard to come by. A contrived example is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d3"
name="e17d3">17.3)</a>    li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo
    the-number 2 plus and times 2 equals the-number 4.
    2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre>

    <p>The forethought form of <a href="#e17d3">Example 17.3</a>
    is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d4" name="e17d4">17.4)</a>    li re ge su'i gi pi'i re
        du li vo
    the-number two both plus and times two
        equals the-number four.
    Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre>
    Non-logical connection with joiks or joigiks is also permitted
    between operands and between operators. One use for this
    construct is to connect operands with ``bi'i'' to create
    mathematical intervals: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d5" name="e17d5">17.5)</a>    li no ga'o bi'i ke'i pa
    the-number zero (inclusive) from-to (exclusive) one
    [0,1)
    the numbers from zero to one,
        including zero but not including one
</pre>
    You can also combine two operands with ``ce'o'', the sequence
    connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound subscript: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e17d6"
name="e17d6">17.6)</a>     xy. boi xi vei by. ce'o dy. [ve'o]
    ``x'' sub ( ``b'' sequence ``d'' )
    $x<sub>b,d</sub>$
</pre>
    Note that the ``boi'' in <a href="#e17d5">Example 17.5</a> is
    not elidable, because the ``xi'' subscript needs something to
    attach to.
