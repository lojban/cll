          <h3><a id="s5" name="s5">5. Forethought bridi connection</h3>

    <p>Many concepts in Lojban are expressible in two different
    ways, generally referred to as ``afterthought'' and
    ``forethought''. <a href="#s4">Section 4</a> discussed what is
    called ``afterthought bridi logical connection''. The word
    ``afterthought'' is used because the connective cmavo and the
    second bridi were added, as it were, afterwards and without
    changing the form of the first bridi. This form might be used
    by someone who makes a statement and then wishes to add or
    qualify that statement after it has been completed. Thus,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  la djan. nanmu
</pre>
    is a complete bridi, and adding an afterthought connection to
    make 
<pre>
<a id="e5d2"
name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a man or James is a woman (or both)
</pre>
    provides additional information without requiring any change in
    the form of what has come before, which may not be possible or
    practical, especially in speaking. (The meaning, however, may
    be changed by the use of a negating connective.) Afterthought
    connectives make it possible to construct all the important
    truth-functional relationships in a variety of ways. 

    <p>In forethought style the speaker decides in advance, before
    expressing the first bridi, that a logical connection will be
    expressed. Forethought and afterthought connectives are
    expressed with separate selma'o: the forethought logical
    connectives corresponding to afterthought ijeks are geks:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d3"
name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  ga la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    Either John is a man or James is a woman (or both).
</pre>
    ``ga'' is the cmavo which represents the <span
    class="c3">A</span> truth function in selma'o GA. The word
    ``gi'' does not belong to GA at all, but constitutes its own
    selma'o: it serves only to separate the two bridi without
    having any content of its own. The English translation of ``ga
    ... gi'' is ``either ... or'', but in the English form the
    truth function is specified both by the word ``either'' and by
    the word ``or'': not so in Lojban. 

    <p>Even though two bridi are being connected, geks and giks do
    not have any ``.i'' in them. The forethought construct binds up
    the two bridi into a single sentence as far as the grammar is
    concerned.</p>

    <p>Some more examples of forethought bridi connection are:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d4"
name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  ge la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    (It is true that)
    both John is a man and James is a woman.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  gu la djan. nanmu
        gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    It is true that John is a man,
        whether or not James is a woman.
</pre>

    <p>It is worth emphasizing that <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a>
    does not assert that James is (or is not) a woman. The ``gu''
    which indicates that ``la djeimyz. ninmu'' may be true or false
    is unfortunately rather remote from the bridi thus
    affected.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most important of the truth functions commonly
    expressed in forethought is TFTT, which can be paraphrased as
    ``if ... then ... '':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d6"
name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ganai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    Either John is not a man, or James is a woman.
    If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre>
    Note the placement of the ``nai'' in <a href="#e5d6">Example
    5.6</a>. When added to afterthought selma'o such as JA, a
    following ``nai'' negates the second bridi, to which it is
    adjacent. Since GA cmavo precede the first bridi, a following
    ``nai'' negates the first bridi instead. 

    <p>Why does English insist on forethought in the translation of
    <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>? Possibly because it would be
    confusing to seemingly assert a sentence and then make it
    conditional (which, as the Lojban form shows, involves a
    negation). Truth functions which involve negating the first
    sentence may be confusing, even to the Lojbanic understanding,
    when expressed using afterthought.</p>

    <p>It must be reiterated here that not every use of English ``if ...
    then'' is properly translated by ``.inaja'' or ``ganai ... gi'';
    anything with implications of time needs a somewhat different Lojban
    translation, which will be discussed in <a href="#s18">Section
    18</a>. Causal sentences like ``If you feed the pig, then it will
    grow'' are not logical connectives of any type, but rather need a
    translation using ``rinka'' as the selbri joining two event
    abstractions, thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  le nu do cidja dunda fi le xarju
        cu rinka le nu ri ba banro
    The event-of (you food-give to the pig)
        causes the event-of (it will grow).
</pre>

    <p>Causality is discussed in far more detail in <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#e5d8">Example 5.8</a> and <a href="#e5d9">Example
    5.9</a> illustrates a truth function, FTTF, which needs to
    negate either the first or the second bridi. We already
    understand how to negate the first bridi:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d8"
name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  gonai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman,
    Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.
</pre>
    How can the second bridi be negated? By adding ``-nai'' to the
    ``gi''. 
<pre>
<a id="e5d9"
name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  go la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman.
    Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.
</pre>
    A compound cmavo based on ``gi'' is called a gik; the only giks
    are ``gi'' itself and ``ginai''. 

    <p>Further examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d10"
name="e5d10">5.10)</a>    ge la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man and James is-not-a-woman.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e5d11"
name="e5d11">5.11)</a>    ganai la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man or James is-not-a-woman.
</pre>
    The syntax of geks is: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[se] GA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
    and of giks (which are not themselves connectives, but part of
    the machinery of forethought connection) is: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>gi [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
