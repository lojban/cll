    <h3><a id="s18" name="s18">18. Tenses, modals, and logical connection</h3>

    <p>The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the
    logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of
    these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view
    of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts
    and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many
    tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI
    are simplified to the simple time cmavo ``pu'', ``ca'', and
    ``ba'' (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and
    the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state
    the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to
    English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the
    event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after
    the event given by the sumti (which is generally a ``le nu''
    abstraction; see <a href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a>).</p>

    <p>The two types of interaction between tenses and logical
    connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical
    connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used
    between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ
    only in tense:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d1" name="e18d1">18.1)</a>    la .artr. pu nolraitru
        .ije la .artr. ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] is-a-noblest-governor.
        And Arthur [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
    Arthur was a king, and Arthur will be a king.
</pre>
    can be reduced to: 
<pre>
<a id="e18d2"
name="e18d2">18.2)</a>    la .artr. pu je ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] and [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
    Arthur was and will be king.
</pre>
    <a href="#e18d1">Example 18.1</a> and <a href="#e18d2">Example
    18.2</a> are equivalent in meaning; neither says anything about
    whether Arthur is king now. 

    <p>Non-logical connection with joiks is also possible between
    tenses:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d3" name="e18d3">18.3)</a>    mi pu bi'o ba vasxu
    I [past] from ... to [future] breathe.
    I breathe from a past time until a future time.
</pre>

    <p>The full tense system makes more interesting tense intervals
    expressible, such as ``from a medium time ago until a long time
    from now''.</p>

    <p>No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by
    the grammar, nor is there any way to override the default
    left-grouping rule; these limitations are imposed to keep the
    tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or
    modals can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time,
    place, or mode explicitly, so it is reasonable to try to remove
    at least some complications.</p>

    <p>Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more
    important than logical connections between tenses. Consider the
    English sentence:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d4"
name="e18d4">18.4)</a>    I went to the market, and I bought food.
</pre>

    <p>The verbatim translation of <a href="#e18d4">Example
    18.4</a>, namely:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d5"
name="e18d5">18.5)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci .ije mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] go-to the market. And I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre>
    fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that
    the buying came after the going. (It also fails to represent
    that the buying was a consequence of the going, which can be
    expressed by a modal that is discussed in <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>.) However, the tense
    information --- that the event of my going to the market
    preceded the event of my buying food --- can be added to the
    logical connective as follows. The ``.ije'' is replaced by
    ``.ijebo'', and the tense cmavo ``ba'' is inserted between
    ``.ije'' and ``bo'': 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d6" name="e18d6">18.6)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
        .ijebabo mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] go-to the market.
        And [later] I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ``pu'' cmavo in the two bridi-tails express the
    time of both actions with respect to the speaker: in the past.
    The ``ba'' relates the two items to one another: the second
    item is later than the first item. The grammar does not permit
    omitting the ``bo''; if it were omitted, the ``ba'' and the
    second ``pu'' would run together to form a compound tense
    ``bapu'' applying to the second bridi-tail only.</p>

    <p>
    Adding tense or modal information to
    a logical connective is permitted only in the following
    situations:</p>

    <p>Between an ek (or joik) and ``bo'', as in:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d7"
name="e18d7">18.7)</a>    la .djan .ecabo la .alis. klama le zarci
    John and [simultaneous] Alice go-to the market.
    John and Alice go to the market simultaneously.
</pre>
    Between an ek (or joik) and ``ke'', as
    in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d8" name="e18d8">18.8)</a>    mi dzukla le zarci
        .epuke le zdani .a le ckule [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market
        and [earlier] ( the house or the school ).
    I walk to the market and,
        before that, to the house or the school.
</pre>
    Between a gihek and ``bo'', as in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d9" name="e18d9">18.9)</a>    mi dunda le cukta
        gi'ebabo lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I give the book
        and [later] take some currency-units from/to you.
    I give you the book and then take some dollars
        (pounds, yen) from you.
</pre>
    Between a gihek and ``ke'', as in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d10" name="e18d10">18.10)</a>  mi dzukla le zarci
        gi'ecake cusku zo'e la djan. [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market
        and [simultaneous] express something to-John.
    I walk to the market and at the same time talk to John.
</pre>
    Between an ijek (or ijoik) and ``bo'',
    as in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d11"
name="e18d11">18.11)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .ijebabo mi viska pa ninmu
    I see a man. And [later] I see a woman.
    I see a man, and then I see a woman.
</pre>
    Between an ijek (or ijoik) and
    ``tu'e'', as in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d12" name="e18d12">18.12)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu
        .ijebatu'e mi viska pa ninmu [tu'u]
    I see a man.
        And [later] I see a woman.
    I see a man, and then I see a woman.
</pre>
    And finally, between a jek (or joik)
    and ``bo'', as in: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d13" name="e18d13">18.13)</a>  mi mikce jebabo ricfu
    I-am-a doctor and [later] rich
    I am a doctor and future rich person.
</pre>
    As can be seen from <a href="#e18d11">Example 18.11</a> and <a
    href="#e18d12">Example 18.12</a>, the choice between ``bo'' and
    ``ke'' (or ``tu'e'') is arbitrary when there are only two
    things to be connected. If there were no tense information to
    include, of course neither would be required; it is only the
    rule that tense information must always be sandwiched between
    the logical connective and a following ``bo'', ``ke'', or
    ``tu'e'' that requires the use of one of these grouping cmavo
    in <a href="#e18d7">Example 18.7</a> and <a
    href="#e18d9">Examples 18.9</a> through <a
    href="#e18d13">18.13</a>. 

    <p>Non-logical connectives with ``bo'' and ``ke'' can include
    tense information in exactly the same way as logical
    connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except as noted
    below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense
    connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also
    include tense information in their logical connectives as a
    result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru
    components respectively:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d14"
name="e18d14">18.14)</a>  vei ci .ebabo vo [ve'o] tadni cu zvati le kumfa
    ( 3 and [future] 4 ) students are-at the room.
    Three and, later, four students were in the room.
</pre>
    is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for
    use when a tense applies to both of the selbri in a forethought
    bridi-tail connection: the entire forethought construction can
    just be preceded by a tense. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d15"
name="e18d15">18.15)</a>  mi pu ge klama le zarci gi tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] both go-to the market and buy some food
    I went to the market and bought some food.
</pre>
    <a href="#e18d15">Example 18.15</a> is similar to <a
    href="#e18d5">Example 18.5</a>. There is no time relationship
    specified between the going and the buying; both are simply set
    in the past.
