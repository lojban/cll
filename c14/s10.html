    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. Multiple compound bridi</h3>

    <p>Giheks can be combined with ``bo'' in the same way as
    eks:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    mi nelci la djan.
        gi'e nelci la martas. gi'abo nelci la meris.
    I like John
        and (like Martha or like Mary).
</pre>
    <p>is equivalent in meaning to <a
    href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> and <a href="#e8d2">Example
    8.2</a>. Likewise, ``ke ... ke'e'' grouping can be used after
    giheks: 
    </p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d2"
name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi dzukla le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani
        gi'a ke dzukla le ckule gi'e dzukla le briju [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market and walk-to the house,
        or walk-to the school and walk-to the office.
</pre>
    is the gihek version of <a href="#e8d9">Example 8.9</a>. The
    same rule about using ``ke ... ke'e'' bracketing only just
    after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the
    first two bridi-tails in <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a>
    cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices
    to associate them. 

    <p>Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks
    can have its own set of tail-terms:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    mi dejni lo rupnu la djan.
        .inaja mi dunda le cukta la djan.
        .ijabo mi lebna le cukta la djan.
    [If] I owe some currency-units to John,
        then I give the book to John
        or I take the book from John.
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d4"
name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi dejni lo rupnu nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau
        le cukta vau la djan.
    [If] I owe some currency-units then (give or take)
        a book to/from John.
</pre>

    <p>The literal English translation in <a href="#e10d4">Example
    10.4</a> is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly
    grammatical. ``mi'' fills the x1 place of all three selbri;
    ``lo rupnu'' is the x2 of ``dejni'', whereas ``le cukta'' is a
    tail-term shared between ``dunda'' and ``lebna''; ``la djan.''
    is a tail-term shared by ``dejni'' and by ``dunda gi'abo
    lebna''. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by
    moving ``la djan.'' to the beginning of the sentence, as in <a
    href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d5"
name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    fi la djan. fa mi dejni lo rupnu
        nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau le cukta
    To/from John, [if] I owe some currency-units
        then [I] give or take the book.
</pre>
    Finally, what about forethought logical connection of
    bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose.
    Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected
    sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the
    sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
    
<pre>
<a id="e10d5.5"
name="e10d5.5">10.5.5)</a>    mi ge klama le zarci gi nelci la djan.
    I both go to the market and like John.
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>. 

    <p>Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain
    giheks:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d6"
name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    mi ge klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani
        gi nelci la djan.
    I both (go to the market and walk to the house)
        and like John.
</pre>
    The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a
    whole by prefixing ``na'': 
<pre>
<a id="e10d7"
name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    mi na ge klama le zarci gi dzukla le zdani
    [False!] I both go to the market and walk to the house.
</pre>
    Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a
    bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought
    equivalent of <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a> is: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    mi ge dunda le cukta
         gi lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I both (give the book)
        and (take some currency-units) to/from you.
</pre>
    Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought
    equivalent of <a href="#e9d9">Example 9.9</a>: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d9"
name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    ge klama le zarci gi dzukla le briju
    Both a goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with
    both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  mi gonai le zarci cu klama
        gi le bisli cu dansu
    I either-but-not-both to-the office go
        or on-the ice dance.
    I either go to the office or dance on the ice
        (but not both).
</pre>
