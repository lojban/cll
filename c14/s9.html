    <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Compound bridi</h3>

    <p>So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need
    have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that
    are identical except for a difference in one sumti (sumti
    connection). It would seem natural to ask how to logically
    connect sentences that are identical except for having
    different selbri.</p>

    <p>Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is
    designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri
    connection is provided as part of a more general-purpose
    mechanism called ``compound bridi''. Compound bridi result from
    logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and
    possibly some of their sumti.</p>

    <p>The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only
    common point:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1"
name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci .ije mi nelci la djan.
    I go to the market, and I like John.
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to the compound bridi: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d2"
name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi klama le zarci gi'e nelci la djan.
    I go-to the market and like John.
</pre>
    As <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> indicates, giheks are used
    in afterthought to create compound bridi; ``gi'e'' is the gihek
    corresponding to ``and''. The actual phrases ``klama le zarci''
    and ``nelci la djan.'' that the gihek connects are known as
    ``bridi-tails'', because they represent (in this use) the
    ``tail end'' of a bridi, including the selbri and any following
    sumti, but excluding any sumti that precede the selbri: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  mi ricfu gi'e klama le zarci
    I am-rich and go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d3">Example 9.3</a>, the first bridi-tail is
    ``ricfu'', a simple selbri, and the second bridi-tail is
    ``klama le zarci'', a selbri with one following sumti.</p>

    <p>Suppose that more than a single sumti is identical between
    the two sentences:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  mi dunda le cukta do
        .ije mi lebna lo rupnu do
    I give the book to-you,
        and I take some currency-units from-you.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a>, the first and last sumti of
    each bridi are identical; the selbri and the second sumti are
    different. By moving the final sumti to the beginning, a form
    analogous to <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> can be achieved: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  fi do fa mi dunda le cukta
        gi'e lebna lo rupnu
    to/from you I give the book
        and take some currency-units.
</pre>
    where the ``fi'' does not have an exact English translation
    because it merely places ``do'' in the third place of both
    ``lebna'' and ``dunda''. However, a form that preserves natural
    sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two
    bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the
    bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to
    both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of <a
    href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a> therefore is: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi dunda le cukta
        gi'e lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I (give the book)
        and (take some currency-units) to/from you.
</pre>
    The ``vau'' (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail
    from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an
    elidable ``vau'', but only in connection with compound bridi is
    it ever necessary to express this ``vau''. Thus: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  mi klama le zarci [vau]
    I go-to the market.
</pre>
    has a single elided ``vau'', and <a href="#e9d2">Example
    9.2</a> is equivalent to: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi klama le zarci [vau]
        gi'e nelci la djan. [vau] [vau]
</pre>
    where the double ``vau'' at the end of <a href="#e9d8">Example
    9.8</a> terminates both the right-hand bridi-tail and the
    unexpressed tail-terms. 

    <p>A final use of giheks is to combine bridi-tails used as
    complete sentences, the Lojban observative:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d9"
name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le briju
    A goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.
</pre>
    Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying <a
    href="#e9d9">Example 9.9</a>, this compound bridi does not
    necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are the same.
    Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than ``zo'e'', which
    is equivalent to omission) can force the goer and the walker to
    be identical. 

    <p>A strong argument for this convention is provided by
    analysis of the following example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d10"
name="e9d10">9.10)</a>     klama la nu,IORK. la finyks.
        gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
    A goer to-New York from-Phoenix
        and a goer to-New York from-Rome.
</pre>

    <p>If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying
    bridi were identified, then (since there is nothing special
    about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5 (means) places
    would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result
    that the route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the
    route from Rome to New York. Inserting ``da'', meaning roughly
    ``something'', into the x1 place cures the problem:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d11"
name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    da klama la nu,IORK. la finyks.
        gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
    Something is-a-goer to-New York from-Phoenix
        and is-a-goer to-New York from-Rome.
</pre>
    The syntax of giheks is: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>[na] [se] GIhA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>
    which is exactly parallel to the syntax of eks.
