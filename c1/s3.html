      <h3>3. What are the typographical conventions of this book?</h3>

<p>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section
contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and
possibly tables.</p>

<p>The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used
throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on
the self-same sentences:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.
    I go to the store.
</a>
</pre>

<p>
will become wearisomely familiar before <a
href="../c21/s1.html">Chapter 21</a> is reached. This method is
deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar
examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical
points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a
textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have
learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is
intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be
Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference
in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the
language. 
</p>

<p>It is useful to talk further about <a href="#e1d1">Example
1.1</a> for what it illustrates about examples in this book.
Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in
Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the
Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The
second and third lines are sometimes called the ``literal
translation'' and the ``colloquial translation'' respectively.
Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are
omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally
means that they have the same meaning.</p>

<p>Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban
texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in
the context of the particular example) be either omitted or
included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used
as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't
have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would
suggest. In <a href="../c3/s1.html">Chapter 3</a>, square brackets
surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic
Alphabet.</p>

<p>Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of
various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains
Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains
the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word)
to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief
English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation.
Other tables are explained in context.</p>

<p>A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All
of these are explained in <a href="../c2/s1.html">Chapter 2</a>,
except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained
in the introductory sections of those chapters.</p>
