To make the XHTML version (ends up in a dir named html/):

  scripts/build

This takes quite a while.  To do it for just one chapter for faster
testing:

  scripts/build -t chapters/05.xml 

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

  scripts/build -t

There are many possible sub-targets as well, which are specified
with -T, such as:

  scripts/build -t -T pdf_web

You can get a complete list of targets via:

  scripts/build -h

Requirements
------------

Getting this all working is actually a pretty huge undertaking;
you're almost certainly better off asking Robin Lee Powell for an
account on the appropriate server.
