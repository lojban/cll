          <h3><a id="14" name="14">14. The identity predicate: du</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   du  GOhA            identity
</pre>
    The cmavo ``du'' has the place structure: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...</dd>
    </dl>
    and appears in selma'o GOhA for reasons of convenience: it is
    not a pro-bridi. ``du'' serves as mathematical ``='', and
    outside mathematical contexts is used for defining or
    identifying. Mathematical examples may be found in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>. 

    <p>The main difference between</p>
<pre>
<a id="14-1" name="14-1">14.1)</a>    ko'a du le nanmu
    it-1 is-identical-to the man
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="14-2" name="14-2">14.2)</a>    ko'a mintu le nanmu
    it-1 is-the-same-as the man
</pre>
    is this defining nature. <a href="#14-1">Example 14.1</a>
    presumes that the speaker is responding to a request for
    information about what ``ko'a'' refers to, or that the speaker
    in some way feels the need to define ``ko'a'' for later
    reference. A bridi with ``du'' is an identity sentence,
    somewhat metalinguistically saying that all attached sumti are
    representations for the same referent. There may be any number
    of sumti associated with ``du'', and all are said to be
    identical. 

    <p><a href="#14-2">Example 14.2</a>, however, predicates; it
    is used to make a claim about the identity of ``ko'a'', which
    presumably has been defined previously.</p>

    <p>Note: ``du'' historically is derived from ``dunli'', but
    ``dunli'' has a third place which ``du'' lacks: the standard of
    equality.</p>
