          <h3><a id="15" name="15">15. lujvo based on pro-sumti</h3>

    <p>There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA,
    but they are rarely used. (See <a href=../16/>Section 16</a>
    for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as
    internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or
    lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand
    as the first rafsi in their lujvo.</p>

    <p>Thus ``donta'a'', meaning ``you-talk'', would be interpreted
    as ``tavla be do'', and would have the place structure</p>
<pre>
<a id="15-1" name="15-1">15.1)</a>    t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
</pre>
    since t2 (the addressee) is already known to be ``do''. 

    <p>On the other hand, the lujvo ``donma'o'', literally
    ``you-cmavo'', which means ``a second person personal
    pronoun'', would be interpreted as ``cmavo be zo do'', and have
    the place structure:</p>
<pre>
<a id="15-2" name="15-2">15.2)</a>    c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
</pre>
    since both the c2 place (the grammatical class) and the c3
    place (the meaning) are obvious from the context ``do''. 

    <p>An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the ``fo'a'' series
    is to express terjvo which can't be expressed in a convenient
    rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are
    formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An
    example would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="15-3" name="15-3">15.3)</a>    fo'a goi le kulnrsu,omi .i lo fo'arselsanga
    x6 stands for Finnish-culture.  An x6-song
</pre>
    Finally, lujvo involving ``zi'o'' are also possible, and are
    fully discussed in <a href="../../12/1/">Chapter 12</a>. In
    brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for ``zi'o'' as a
    prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the
    place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something
    drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a ``se
    pinxe be zi'o'', the lujvo corresponding to this is
    ``zilrelselpinxe'' (deleting the second place of ``se pinxe'').
    Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining
    places up by one. This would mean that ``zilpavypinxe'' has the
    same place structure as ``zilrelselpinxe'', and ``lo
    zilpavypinxe'', like ``lo zilrelselpinxe'', refers to a
    beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker. 

    <p>The pro-bridi ``co'e'', ``du'', and ``bu'a'' also have
    rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The
    resulting lujvo have (except for ``du''-based lujvo) highly
    context-dependent meanings.</p>
