<h2>Chapter 7<br />
      Brevity Is The Soul Of Language: Pro-sumti And Pro-bridi</h2>
          <h3>1. What are pro-sumti and pro-bridi? What are they
    for?</h3>

    <p>Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages,
    require mechanisms of abbreviation. If every time we referred
    to something, we had to express a complete description of it,
    life would be too short to say what we have to say. In English,
    we have words called “pronouns” which allow us to replace
    nouns or noun phrases with shorter terms. An English with no
    pronouns might look something like this:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages,
    require mechanisms of abbreviation.  If every time
    speakers of Lojban referred to a thing to which
    speakers of Lojban refer, speakers of Lojban had to
    express a complete description of what speakers
    of Lojban referred to, life would be too short to say
    what speakers of Lojban have to say.
</pre>
    Speakers of this kind of English would get mightily sick of
    talking. Furthermore, there are uses of pronouns in English
    which are independent of abbreviation. There is all the
    difference in the world between: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">1.2)</a>  John picked up a stick and shook it.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">1.3)</a>  John picked up a stick and shook a stick.
</pre>
    <a href="../1/#3">Example 1.3</a> does not imply that the two
    sticks are necessarily the same, whereas <a
    href="../1/#2">Example 1.2</a> requires that they are. 

    <p>In Lojban, we have sumti rather than nouns, so our
    equivalent of pronouns are called by the hybrid term
    “pro-sumti”. A purely Lojban term would be “sumti cmavo”:
    all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In
    exactly the same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to
    selma'o GOhA) which serve as selbri or full bridi. These may be
    called “pro-bridi” or “bridi cmavo”. This chapter explains
    the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall
    into a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o
    KOhA, we have among others the mi-series, the ko'a-series, the
    da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of pro-sumti is
    explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi,
    it is explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't
    have pro-bridi analogues, however.</p>

    <p>A few technical terms: The term “referent” means the thing
    to which a pro-sumti (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the
    speaker of a sentence is James, then the referent of the word
    “I” is James. On the other hand, the term “antecedent”
    refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi)
    implicitly repeats. In</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">1.4)</a>  John loves himself
</pre>
    the antecedent of “himself” is “John”; not the person, but
    a piece of text (a name, in this case). John, the person, would
    be the referent of “himself”. Not all pro-sumti or pro-bridi
    have antecedents, but all of them have referents.
