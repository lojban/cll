<h3>7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and the co'e-series</h3>
<p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     zo'e    KOhA  zo'e-series   the obvious value
     zu'i    KOhA  zo'e-series   the typical value
     zi'o    KOhA  zo'e-series   the nonexistent value

     co'e    GOhA  co'e-series   has the obvious relationship
</pre>
<p>The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified sumti. The cmavo “zo'e” represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being defined as “whatever I want it to mean but haven’t bothered to figure out, or figure out how to express”.</p>
<p>The cmavo “zu'i”, on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place of this bridi:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">7.1)</a>   mi klama le bartu be le zdani le nenri be le zdani
              zu'i zu'i
       I go to-the outside of the house from-the inside of the house
              [by-typical-route] [by-typical-means]
</pre>
In <a href="../7/#e1">Example 7.1</a>, the first “zu'i” probably means something like “by the door”, and the second “zu'i” probably means something like “on foot”, those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither “zu'i” is appropriate. It’s also common to use “zu'i” in “by standard” places.
<p>Finally, the cmavo “zi'o” represents a value which does not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with “zi'o”, what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express. For example, the place structure of “zbasu” is</p>
<pre>
             zbasu: actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3
</pre>
Consider the sentence
<pre>
      Living things are made from cells.
</pre>
This cannot be correctly expressed as:
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">7.2)</a>   loi jmive cu se zbasu [zo'e] fi loi selci
       The-mass-of living-things is-made [by-something] from the-mass-of cells
</pre>
because the “zo'e”, expressed or understood, in <a href="../7/#e2">Example 7.2</a> indicates that there is still a “maker” in this relationship. We do not generally suppose, however, that someone “makes” living things from cells. The best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a “maker”: however, an alternative strategy is to use “zi'o” to eliminate the maker place:
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">7.3)</a>   loi jmive cu se zbasu zi'o loi selci
       The-mass-of living-things is-made [without-maker] from the-mass-of cells.
</pre>
Note: The use of “zi'o” to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">7.4)</a>   mi zbasu le dinju loi mudri
       I make the building from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
       I make the building out of wood.

<a id="e5" name="e5">7.5)</a>   zi'o zbasu le dinju loi mudri
       [without-maker] makes the building from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
       The building is made out of wood.

<a id="e6" name="e6">7.6)</a>   mi zbasu zi'o loi mudri
       I make [without-thing-made] from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
       I build using wood.

<a id="e7" name="e7">7.7)</a>   mi zbasu le dinju zi'o
       I make the building [without-material].
       I make the building.
</pre>
If <a href="../7/#e4">Example 7.4</a> is true, then <a href="../7/#e5">Examples 7.5</a> through <a href="../7/#e7">7.7</a> must be true also. However, <a href="../7/#e3">Example 7.3</a> does not correspond to any sentence with three regular (non-“zi'o”) sumti.
<p>The pro-bridi “co'e” (which by itself constitutes the co'e-series of selma'o GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri. Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of “co'e” as a selbri place-holder:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8" name="e8">7.8)</a>   mi troci le nu mi co'e le vorme
       I try the event-of my [doing-the-obvious-action] to-the door.
       I try the door.
</pre>
The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.
<p>The form of “co'e” was chosen to resemble “zo'e”; the cmavo “do'e” of selma'o BAI (see <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a>) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.</p>
<p>Note that “do'i”, of the di'u-series, is also a kind of indefinite pro-sumti: it is indefinite in referent, but is restricted to referring only to an utterance.</p>
