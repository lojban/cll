          <h3><a id="9" name="9">9. sumti and bridi questions: ``ma'' and ``mo''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ma  KOhA            sumti question
    mo  GOhA            bridi question
</pre>
    Lojban questions are more fully explained in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>, but ``ma'' and ``mo'' are
    listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo ``ma'' asks
    for a sumti to make the bridi true: 
<pre>
<a id="9-1" name="9-1">9.1)</a>  do klama ma
    You go to-what-destination?
    Where are you going?
</pre>
    The cmavo ``mo'', on the other hand, asks for a selbri which
    makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi,
    then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the
    question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple
    example is: 
<pre>
<a id="9-2" name="9-2">9.2)</a>  do mo
    What predicate is true as applied to you?
    How are you?
    What are you doing?
    What are you?
</pre>
    <a href="#9-3">Example 9.3</a> is a truly pregnant question
    that will have several meanings depending on context. 

    <p>(One thing it probably does not mean is ``Who are you?'' in
    the sense ``What is your name/identity?'', which is better
    expressed by:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-3" name="9-3">9.3)</a>  ma cmene do
    What sumti is-the-name-of you?
    What is your name?
</pre>
    or even 
<pre>
<a id="9-4" name="9-4">9.4)</a>  doi ma
    O [what sumti?]
</pre>
    which uses the vocative ``doi'' to address someone, and
    simultaneously asks who the someone is.) 

    <p>A further example of ``mo'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="9-5" name="9-5">9.5)</a>  lo mo prenu cu darxi do
        .i barda
    A [what selbri?] type-of person hit you?
        (Observative:) A big thing.
    Which person hit you?  The big one.
</pre>
    When ``ma'' or ``mo'' is repeated, multiple questions are being
    asked simultaneously: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-6" name="9-6">9.6)</a>  ma djuno ma
    [what sumti] knows [what sumti]?
    Who knows what?
</pre>
