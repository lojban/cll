<h3>2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series</h3>
<p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     mi      KOhA  mi-series     I, me
     do      KOhA  mi-series     you
     mi'o    KOhA  mi-series     you and I
     mi'a    KOhA  mi-series     I and others, we but not you
     ma'a    KOhA  mi-series     you and I and others
     do'o    KOhA  mi-series     you and others
     ko      KOhA  mi-series     you-imperative
</pre>
<p>The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. “mi” refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. “do” refers to the listener or listeners. Neither “mi” nor “do” is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as “mi”, since in speaking officially he represents all of them.</p>
<p>The referents of “mi” and “do” are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in <a href="../../13/1/">Chapter 13</a>. The vocative “mi'e” assigns “mi”, whereas all of the other vocatives assign “do”.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">2.1)</a>   mi'e djan. doi frank.  mi cusku lu mi bajra li'u do
       I-am John, O Frank, I express [quote] I run [unquote] to-you
       I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.
</pre>
<p>The cmavo “mi'o”, “mi'a”, “ma'a”, and “do'o” express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:</p>
<ul>
<li>“mi'o” includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;</li>
<li>“mi'a” includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;</li>
<li>“do'o” includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;</li>
<li>“ma'a” includes all three: speaker, listener, others.</li>
</ul>
All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, “mi'o” is the same as “mi joi do”, the mass of me and you considered jointly.
<p>In English, “we” can mean “mi” or “mi'o” or “mi'a” or even “ma'a”, and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish “mi'o” from “mi'a”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">2.2)</a>   We’re going to the store.
</pre>
Does this include the listener or not? There’s no way to be sure.
<p>Finally, the cmavo “ko” is logically equivalent to “do”; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">2.3)</a>   do klama le zarci
       You go to-the store.
</pre>
becomes:
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">2.4)</a>   ko klama le zarci
       You [imperative] go to-the store.
       Make “you go to the store” true!
       Go to the store!
</pre>
<p>In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word “ko” must be used. However, “ko” does not have to appear in the x1 place:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">2.5)</a>   mi viska ko
       I see you [imperative]
       Make “I see you” true!
       Be seen by me!
</pre>
In <a href="../2/#e5">Example 2.5</a>, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of “ko” in the x2 place. Indeed, “ko” does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
<pre>
<a id="e6" name="e6">2.6)</a>   mi viska le prenu poi prami ko
       I see the person that loves you [imperative]
       Make “I see the person that loves you” true!
       Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!
       Show me the person who loves you!
</pre>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="../1/">Section 1</a>, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn’t a relationship.</p>
