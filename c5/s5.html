    <h3><a id="s5" name="s5">5. Complex tanru with ``ke'' and ``ke'e''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ke  KE  start grouping
    ke'e    KEhE    end grouping
</pre>
    There is, in fact, a fifth grouping of ``pretty little girls'
    school'' that cannot be expressed with the resources explained
    so far. To handle it, we must introduce the grouping
    parentheses cmavo, ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' (belonging to selma'o KE
    and KEhE respectively). Any portion of a selbri sandwiched
    between these two cmavo is taken to be a single tanru
    component, independently of what is adjacent to it. Thus, <a
    href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> can be rewritten in any of the
    following ways: 
<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  ta ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ckule
    That is-a-( pretty little ) girl school.

<a id="e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>   ta ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
    That is-a-( ( pretty little ) girl ) school.

<a id="e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>   ta ke ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule ke'e
    That is-a-( ( ( pretty little ) girl ) school ).
</pre>

    <p>Even more versions could be created simply by placing any
    number of ``ke'' cmavo at the beginning of the selbri, and a
    like number of ``ke'e'' cmavo at its end. Obviously, all of
    these are a waste of breath once the left-grouping rule has
    been grasped. However, the following is equivalent to <a
    href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> and may be easier to
    understand:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  ta melbi ke cmalu nixli ke'e
        ckule
    That is-a-(pretty type-of ( little type-of girl ))
        type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, a ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' version of <a
    href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ta melbi cmalu
        ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-(pretty type-of little)
        ( girl type-of school ).
</pre>

    <p>The final ``ke'e'' is given in square brackets here to
    indicate that it can be elided. It is always possible to elide
    ``ke'e'' at the end of the selbri, making <a
    href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a> as terse as <a
    href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a>.</p>

    <p>Now how about that fifth grouping? It is</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ta melbi
        ke cmalu nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-pretty type-of
        ( (little type-of girl) type-of school )
    That is a beautiful school for small girls.
</pre>
    <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a> is distinctly different in
    meaning from any of Examples 4.2 through 4.5. Note that within
    the ``ke ... ke'e'' parentheses, the left-grouping rule is
    applied to ``cmalu nixli ckule''. 

    <p>It is perfectly all right to mix ``bo'' and ``ke ... ke'e''
    in a single selbri. For instance, <a href="#e4d5">Example
    4.5</a>, which in pure ``ke ... ke'e'' form is</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ta melbi
        ke cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e] [ke'e]
    That is-a-pretty type-of
        ( little type-of ( girl type-of school ) ).
</pre>
    can equivalently be expressed as: 
<pre>
<a id="e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  ta melbi
        ke cmalu nixli bo ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-pretty
        type-of ( little type-of (girl type-of school) ).
</pre>
    and in many other different forms as well.
