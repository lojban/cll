    <h3><a id="s3" name="s3">3. Three-part tanru grouping with ``bo''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   bo  BO  closest scope grouping
</pre>
    Consider the English sentence: 
<pre>
<a id="e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  That's a little girls' school.
</pre>

    <p>What does it mean? Two possible readings are:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  That's a little school for girls.

<a id="e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>   That's a school for little girls.
</pre>
    This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru
    ambiguity described in <a href="s2.html">Section 2</a>. We
    understand that ``girls' school'' means ``a school where girls
    are the students'', and not ``a school where girls are the
    teachers'' or ``a school which is a girl'' (!). Likewise, we
    understand that ``little girl'' means ``girl who is small''.
    This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is ``girls' school'' to be
    taken as a unit, with ``little'' specifying the type of girls'
    school? Or is ``little girl'' to be taken as a unit, specifying
    the type of school? In English speech, different tones of
    voice, or exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are
    used to make the distinction; English writing usually leaves it
    unrepresented. 

    <p>Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose;
    explicit words are used to do the work. The cmavo ``bo'' (which
    belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the two brivla
    which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban
    translation of <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a> would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-small girl -- school.
</pre>
    <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> might be translated: 
<pre>
<a id="e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
    That is-a-small -- girl school.
</pre>

    <p>The ``bo'' is represented in the literal translation by a
    hyphen because in written English a hyphen is sometimes used
    for the same purpose: ``a big dog-catcher'' would be quite
    different from a ``big-dog catcher'' (presumably someone who
    catches only big dogs).</p>

    <p>Analysis of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> and <a
    href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a> reveals a tanru nested within a
    tanru. In <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, the main tanru has a
    seltau of ``cmalu'' and a tertau of ``nixli bo ckule''; the
    tertau is itself a tanru with ``nixli'' as the seltau and
    ``ckule'' as the tertau. In <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, on
    the other hand, the seltau is ``cmalu bo nixli'' (itself a
    tanru), whereas the tertau is ``ckule''. This structure of
    tanru nested within tanru forms the basis for all the more
    complex types of selbri that will be explained below.</p>

    <p>What about <a href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a>? What does it
    mean?</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  ta cmalu nixli ckule
    That is-a-small girl school.
</pre>
    The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as
    the rules of English do with <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a>.
    The choice made by the language designers is to say that <a
    href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a> means the same as <a
    href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>. This is true no matter what three
    brivla are used: the leftmost two are always grouped together.
    This rule is called the ``left-grouping rule''. Left-grouping
    in seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common --- though
    not universal --- in other contexts in Lojban. 

    <p>Another way to express the English meaning of <a
    href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> and <a href="#e3d5">Example
    3.5</a>, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-small type-of (girl type-of school).

<a id="e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>   ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
    That is-a-(small type-of girl) type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>Because ``type-of'' is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it
    has no Lojban equivalent.</p>

    <p>Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert
    ``bo'' into a simple tanru:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  ta klama bo jubme
    That is-a goer -- table
</pre>
    is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as <a
    href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a>, and is ambiguous in exactly the
    same ways. The cmavo ``bo'' serves only to resolve grouping
    ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity
    present in all tanru.
