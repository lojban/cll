    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. selbri based on sumti: ``me''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   me  ME  changes sumti to simple selbri
    me'u    MEhU    terminator for ``me''
</pre>
    A sumti can be made into a simple selbri by preceding it with
    ``me'' (of selma'o ME) and following it with the elidable
    terminator ``me'u'' (of selma'o MEhU). This makes a selbri with
    the place structure 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is one of the referents of ``[the sumti]''</dd>
    </dl>
    which is true of the thing, or things, that are the referents
    of the sumti, and not of anything else. For example, consider
    the sumti 
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    le ci nolraitru
    the three noblest-governors
    the three kings
</pre>
    If these are understood to be the Three Kings of Christian
    tradition, who arrive every year on January 6, then we may say:
    
<pre>
<a id="e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    la BALtazar. cu me le ci nolraitru
    Balthazar is one-of-the-referents-of ``the three kings''.
    Balthazar is one of the three kings.
</pre>
    and likewise 
<pre>
<a id="e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    la kaspar. cu me le ci nolraitru
    Caspar is one of the three kings.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    la melxi,or. cu me le ci nolraitru
    Melchior is one of the three kings.
</pre>
    If the sumti refers to a single object, then the effect of
    ``me'' is much like that of ``du'': 
<pre>
<a id="e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    do du la djan.
    You are-identical-with the-one-called ``John''.
    You are John.
</pre>
    means the same as 
<pre>
<a id="e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    do me la djan.
    You are-the-referent-of ``the-one-called `John'''.
    You are John.
</pre>
    It is common to use ``me'' selbri, especially those based on
    name sumti using ``la'', as seltau. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    ta me lai kraislr. [me'u] karce
    That (is-a-referent of ``the-mass-called `Chrysler''') car.
    That is a Chrysler car.
</pre>
    The elidable terminator ``me'u'' can usually be omitted. It is
    absolutely required only if the ``me'' selbri is being used in
    an indefinite description (a type of sumti explained in <a
    href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>), and if the indefinite
    description is followed by a relative clause (explained in <a
    href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>) or a sumti logical connective
    (explained in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>). Without a
    ``me'u'', the relative clause or logical connective would
    appear to belong to the sumti embedded in the ``me''
    expression. Here is a contrasting pair of sentences: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    re me le ci nolraitru .e la djan. [me'u] cu blabi
    Two of the group ``the three kings and John'' are white.

<a id="e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a> re me le ci nolraitru me'u .e la djan. cu blabi
    Two of the three kings, and John, are white.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> the ``me'' selbri
    covers the three kings plus John, and the indefinite
    description picks out two of them that are said to be white: we
    cannot say which two. In <a href="#e10d9">Example 10.9</a>,
    though, the ``me'' selbri covers only the three kings: two of
    them are said to be white, and so is John.</p>

    <p>Finally, here is another example requiring ``me'u'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  ta me la'e le se cusku be do me'u cukta
    That  is-a-(what-you-said) type of book.
    That is the kind of book you were talking about.
</pre>

    <p>There are other sentences where either ``me'u'' or some
    other elidable terminator must be expressed:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>  le me le ci nolraitru [ku] me'u nunsalci
    the (the three kings) type-of-event-of-celebrating
    the Three Kings celebration
</pre>
    requires either ``ku'' or ``me'u'' to be explicit, and (as with
    ``be'o'' in <a href="s7.html">Section 7</a>) the ``me'u'' leaves no
    doubt which cmavo it is paired with.
