    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Inversion of tanru: ``co''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   co  CO  tanru inversion marker
</pre>
    The standard order of Lojban tanru, whereby the modifier
    precedes what it modifies, is very natural to English-speakers:
    we talk of ``blue houses'', not of ``houses blue''. In other
    languages, however, such matters are differently arranged, and
    Lojban supports this reverse order (tertau before seltau) by
    inserting the particle ``co''. <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a>
    and <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a> mean exactly the same
    thing: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  ta blanu zdani
    That is-a-blue type-of-house.
    That is a blue house.

<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>   ta zdani co blanu
    That is-a-house of-type blue.
    That is a blue house.
</pre>
    This change is called ``tanru inversion''. In tanru inversion,
    the element before ``co'' (``zdani'' in <a href="#e8d2">Example
    8.2</a>) is the tertau, and the element following ``co''
    (``blanu'') in <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a>) is the seltau. 

    <p>The meaning, and more specifically, the place structure, of
    a tanru is not affected by inversion: the place structure of
    ``zdani co blanu'' is still that of ``zdani''. However, the
    existence of inversion in a selbri has a very special effect on
    any sumti which follow that selbri. Instead of being
    interpreted as filling places of the selbri, they actually fill
    the places (starting with x2) of the seltau. In <a
    href="s7.html">Section 7</a>, we saw how to fill interior places
    with ``be ... bei ... be'o'', and in fact <a
    href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> and <a href="#e8d4">Example
    8.4</a> have the same meaning:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi klama be le zarci bei le zdani be'o
        troci
    I am-a-(goer to the market from the house)
        type-of trier.
    I try to go to the market from the house.

<a id="e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>   mi troci co klama le zarci le zdani
    I am-a-trier
        of-type (goer to-the market from-the house).
    I try to go to the market from the house.
</pre>
    <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a> is a less deeply nested
    construction, requiring fewer cmavo. As a result it is probably
    easier to understand. 

    <p>Note that in Lojban ``trying to go'' is expressed using
    ``troci'' as the tertau. The reason is that ``trying to go'' is
    a ``going type of trying'', not a ``trying type of going''. The
    trying is more fundamental than the going --- if the attempt
    fails, we may not have a going at all.</p>

    <p>Any sumti which precede a selbri with an inverted tanru fill
    the places of the selbri (i.e., the places of the tertau) in
    the ordinary way. In <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a>, ``mi''
    fills the x1 place of ``troci co klama'', which is the x1 place
    of ``troci''. The other places of the selbri remain unfilled.
    The trailing sumti ``le zarci'' and ``le zdani'' do not occupy
    selbri places, despite appearances.</p>

    <p>As a result, the regular mechanisms (involving selma'o VOhA
    and GOhI, explained in <a href="../c7/s1.html">Chapter 7</a>) for
    referring to individual sumti of a bridi cannot refer to any of
    the trailing places of <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a>, because
    they are not really ``sumti of the bridi'' at all.</p>

    <p>When inverting a more complex tanru, it is possible to
    invert it only at the most general modifier-modified pair. The
    only possible inversion of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, for
    instance, is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  ta nixli [bo] ckule co cmalu
    that (is-a-girl type-of school) of-type little.
    That's a girls' school which is small.
</pre>
    Note that the ``bo'' of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> is
    optional in <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a>, because ``co''
    groups more loosely than any other cmavo used in tanru,
    including none at all. Not even ``ke ... ke'e'' parentheses can
    encompass a ``co'': 
<pre>
<a id="e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  ta cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
        co melbi
    that is-a-(little type-of (girl type-of school))
        of-type pretty.
    That's a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a>, the ``ke'e'' is
    automatically inserted before the ``co'' rather than at its
    usual place at the end of the selbri. As a result, there is a
    simple and mechanical rule for removing ``co'' from any selbri:
    change ``A co B'' to ``ke B ke'e A''. (At the same time, any
    sumti following the selbri must be transformed into ``be ...
    bei ... be'o'' form and attached following B.) Therefore, 
<pre>
<a id="e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  ckule co melbi nixli
    school of-type pretty girl
    school for beautiful girls
</pre>
    means the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  ke melbi nixli ke'e ckule
    ( pretty girl ) school
</pre>
    Multiple ``co'' cmavo can appear within a selbri, indicating
    multiple inversions: a right-grouping rule is employed, as for
    ``bo''. The above rule can be applied to interpret such selbri,
    but all ``co'' cmavo must be removed simultaneously: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  ckule co nixli co cmalu
    school of-type (girl of-type little)
</pre>
    becomes formally 
<pre>
<a id="e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>    ke ke cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
    ( ( little ) girl ) school
</pre>
    which by the left-grouping rule is simply 
<pre>
<a id="e8d11" name="e8d11">8.11)</a>    cmalu nixli ckule
    little girl school
    school for little girls
</pre>

    <p>As stated above, the selbri places, other than the first,
    of</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d12" name="e8d12">8.12)</a>    mi klama co sutra
    I am-a-goer of-type quick
    I go quickly
</pre>
    cannot be filled by placing sumti after the selbri, because any
    sumti in that position fill the places of ``sutra'', the
    seltau. However, the tertau places (which means in effect the
    selbri places) can be filled with ``be'': 
<pre>
<a id="e8d13" name="e8d13">8.13)</a>    mi klama be le zarci co sutra
    I am-a-goer (to the store) of-type quick.
    I go to the store quickly.
</pre>
