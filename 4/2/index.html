          <h3>2. cmavo</h3>

    <p>The first group of Lojban words discussed in this chapter
    are the cmavo. They are the structure words that hold the
    Lojban language together. They often have no semantic meaning
    in themselves, though they may affect the semantics of brivla
    to which they are attached. The cmavo include the equivalent of
    English articles, conjunctions, prepositions, numbers, and
    punctuation marks. There are over a hundred subcategories of
    cmavo, known as “selma'o”, each having a specifically defined
    grammatical usage. The various selma'o are discussed throughout
    <a href="../../5/1/">Chapters 5</a> to <a
    href="../../19/1/">19</a> and summarized in <a
    href="../../20/1/">Chapter 20</a>.</p>

    <p>Standard cmavo occur in four forms defined by their word
    structure. Here are some examples of the various forms:</p>
<pre>
   V-form      .a  .e  .i  .o  .u
    CV-form     ba  ce  di  fo  gu
    VV-form     .au .ei .ia .o'u    .u'e
    CVV-form    ki'a    pei mi'o    coi cu'u
</pre>

    <p>In addition, there is the cmavo “.y.” (remember that “y”
    is not a V), which must have pauses before and after it.</p>

    <p>A simple cmavo thus has the property of having only one or
    two vowels, or of having a single consonant followed by one or
    two vowels. Words consisting of three or more vowels in a row,
    or a single consonant followed by three or more vowels, are
    also of cmavo form, but are reserved for experimental use: a
    few examples are “ku'a'e”, “sau'e”, and “bai'ai”. All CVV
    cmavo beginning with the letter “x” are also reserved for
    experimental use. In general, though, the form of a cmavo tells
    you little or nothing about its grammatical use.</p>

    <p>“Experimental use” means that the language designers will
    not assign any standard meaning or usage to these words, and
    words and usages coined by Lojban speakers will not appear in
    official dictionaries for the indefinite future.
    Experimental-use words provide an escape hatch for adding
    grammatical mechanisms (as opposed to semantic concepts) the
    need for which was not foreseen.</p>

    <p>The cmavo of VV-form include not only the diphthongs and
    vowel pairs listed in <a href=../1/>Section 1</a>, but also the
    following ten additional diphthongs:</p>
<pre>
   .ia .ie .ii .io .iu
    .ua .ue .ui .uo .uu
</pre>

    <p>In addition, cmavo can have the form “Cy”, a consonant
    followed by the letter “y”. These cmavo represent letters of
    the Lojban alphabet, and are discussed in detail in <a
    href="../../17/1/">Chapter 17</a>.</p>

    <p>Compound cmavo are sequences of cmavo attached together to
    form a single written word. A compound cmavo is always
    identical in meaning and in grammatical use to the separated
    sequence of simple cmavo from which it is composed. These words
    are written in compound form merely to save visual space, and
    to ease the reader's burden in identifying when the component
    cmavo are acting together.</p>

    <p>Compound cmavo, while not visually short like their
    components, can be readily identified by two
    characteristics:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>They have no consonant pairs or clusters, and</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>They end in a vowel.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  .iseci'i
    .i se ci'i

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   punaijecanai
    pu nai je ca nai

<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>   ki'e.u'e
    ki'e .u'e
</pre>
    The cmavo “.u'e” begins with a vowel, and like all words
    beginning with a vowel, requires a pause (represented by “.”)
    before it. This pause cannot be omitted simply because the
    cmavo is incorporated into a compound cmavo. On the other hand,
    
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>  ki'e'u'e
</pre>
    is a single cmavo reserved for experimental purposes: it has
    four vowels. 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>  cy.ibu.abu
    cy. .ibu .abu
</pre>

    <p>Again the pauses are required (see <a href=../9/>Section
    9</a>); the pause after “cy.” merges with the pause before
    “.ibu”.</p>

    <p>There is no particular stress required in cmavo or their
    compounds. Some conventions do exist that are not mandatory.
    For two-syllable cmavo, for example, stress is typically placed
    on the first vowel; an example is</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>  .e'o ko ko kurji
    .E'o ko ko KURji
</pre>

    <p>This convention results in a consistent rhythm to the
    language, since brivla are required to have penultimate stress;
    some find this esthetically pleasing.</p>

    <p>If the final syllable of one word is stressed, and the first
    syllable of the next word is stressed, you must insert a pause
    or glottal stop between the two stressed syllables. Thus</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">2.7)</a>  le re nanmu
</pre>
    can be optionally pronounced 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">2.8)</a>  le RE. NANmu
</pre>
    since there are no rules forcing stress on either of the first
    two words; the stress on “re”, though, demands that a pause
    separate “re” from the following syllable “nan” to ensure
    that the stress on “nan” is properly heard as a stressed
    syllable. The alternative pronunciation 
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">2.9)</a>  LE re NANmu
</pre>
    is also valid; this would apply secondary stress (used for
    purposes of emphasis, contrast or sentence rhythm) to “le”,
    comparable in rhythmical effect to the English phrase “THE two
    men”. In <a href="../2/#8">Example 2.8</a>, the secondary stress
    on “re” would be similar to that in the English phrase “the
    TWO men”. 

    <p>Both cmavo may also be left unstressed, thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">2.10)</a>    le re NANmu
</pre>

    <p>This would probably be the most common usage.</p>
