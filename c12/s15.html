    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Comparatives and superlatives</h3>

    <p>English has the concepts of ``comparative adjectives'' and
    ``superlative adjectives'' which can be formed from other
    adjectives, either by adding the suffixes ``-er'' and ``-est''
    or by using the words ``more'' and ``most'', respectively. The
    Lojbanic equivalents, which can be made from any brivla, are
    lujvo with the tertau ``zmadu'', ``mleca'', ``zenba'',
    ``jdika'', and ``traji''. In order to make these lujvo regular
    and easy to make, certain special guidelines are imposed.</p>

    <p>We will begin with lujvo based on ``zmadu'' and ``mleca'',
    whose place structures are:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d1"
name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    ``zmadu'': z1 is more than z2 in property z3
        in quantity z4
    ``mleca'': m1 is less than m2 in property m3
        in quantity m4
</pre>

    <p>For example, the concept ``young'' is expressed by the gismu
    ``citno'', with place structure</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    ``citno'':  c1 is young
</pre>
    The comparative concept ``younger'' can be expressed by the
    lujvo ``citmau'' (based on the veljvo ``citno zmadu'', meaning
    ``young more-than''). 
<pre>
<a id="e15d3"
name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    mi citmau do lo nanca be li xa
    I am-younger-than you by-years the-number six.
    I am six years younger than you.
</pre>

    <p>The place structure for ``citmau'' is</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d4"
name="e15d4">15.4)</a>    z1=c1 is younger than z2=c1 by amount z4
</pre>

    <p>Similarly, in Lojban you can say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d5"
name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    do citme'a mi lo nanca be li xa
    You are-less-young-than me by-years the-number six.
    You are six years less young than me.
</pre>

    <p>In English, ``more'' comparatives are easier to make and use
    than ``less'' comparatives, but in Lojban the two forms are
    equally easy.</p>

    <p>Because of their much simpler place structure, lujvo ending
    in ``-mau'' and ``-me'a'' are in fact used much more frequently
    than ``zmadu'' and ``mleca'' themselves as selbri. It is highly
    unlikely for such lujvo to be construed as anything other than
    implicit-abstraction lujvo. But there is another type of
    ambiguity relevant to these lujvo, and which has to do with
    what is being compared.</p>

    <p>For example, does ``nelcymau'' mean ``X likes Y more than X
    likes Z'', or ``X likes Y more than Z likes Y''? Does
    ``klamau'' mean: ``X goes to Y more than to Z'', ``X goes to Y
    more than Z does'', ``X goes to Y from Z more than from W'', or
    what?</p>

    <p>We answer this concern by putting regularity above any
    considerations of concept usefulness: by convention, the two
    things being compared always fit into the first place of the
    seltau. In that way, each of the different possible
    interpretations can be expressed by SE-converting the seltau,
    and making the required place the new first place. As a result,
    we get the following comparative lujvo place structures:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d6"
name="e15d6">15.6)</a>    ``nelcymau'': z1, more than z2, likes n2
        by amount z4
    ``selnelcymau'': z1, more than z2, is liked by n1
        in amount z4
    ``klamau'': z1, more than z2, goes to k2 from k3
        via k4 by means of k5
    ``selklamau'': z1, more than z2, is gone to by k1
        from k3 via k4 by means of k5
    ``terklamau'': z1, more than z2, is an origin point
        from destination k2 for k1's going via k4
        by means of k5
</pre>
    (See <a href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a> for the way in which
    this problem is resolved when lujvo aren't used.) 

    <p>The ordering rule places the things being compared first,
    and the other seltau places following. Unfortunately the z4
    place, which expresses by how much one entity exceeds the
    other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is
    different for each lujvo. For example, while ``nelcymau'' has
    z4 as its fourth place, ``klamau'' has it as its sixth place.
    In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place
    can be redundantly tagged with ``vemau'' (for ``zmadu'') or
    ``veme'a'' (for ``mleca'') to help make the speaker's intention
    clear.</p>

    <p>It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do
    not presuppose their seltau. Just as in English, saying someone
    is younger than someone else doesn't imply that they're young
    in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still
    younger than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a
    greater ``ni citno'' than the 90-year-old. Similarly, a
    5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not considered
    ``old'' by most standards.</p>

    <p>There are some comparative concepts which are in which the
    ``se zmadu'' is difficult to specify. Typically, these involve
    comparisons implicitly made with a former state of affairs,
    where stating a z2 place explicitly would be problematic.</p>

    <p>In such cases, it is best not to use ``zmadu'' and leave the
    comparison hanging, but to use instead the gismu ``zenba'',
    meaning ``increase'' (and ``jdika'', meaning ``decrease'', in
    place of ``mleca''). The gismu ``zenba'' was included in the
    language precisely in order to capture those notions of
    increase which ``zmadu'' can't quite cope with; in addition, we
    don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru on something that
    we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate
    ``I'm stronger now'' not as</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a>    mi ca tsamau
    I now am-stronger.
</pre>
    which implies that I'm stronger than somebody else (the elided
    occupant of the second or z2 place), but as 
<pre>
<a id="e15d8" name="e15d8">15.8)</a>    mi ca tsaze'a
    I increase in strength.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, lujvo with a tertau of ``traji'' are used to build
    superlatives. The place structure of ``traji'' is</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d9"
name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    t1 is superlative in property t2, being
        the t3 extremum (largest by default) of set t4
</pre>

    <p>Consider the gismu ``xamgu'', whose place structure is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d10"
name="e15d10">15.10)</a>  xa1 is good for xa2 by standard xa3
</pre>
    The comparative form is ``xagmau'', corresponding to English
    ``better'', with a place structure (by the rules given above)
    of 
<pre>
<a id="e15d11"
name="e15d11">15.11)</a>  z1 is better than z2 for xa2 by standard xa3
        in amount z4
</pre>
    We would expect the place structure of ``xagrai'', the
    superlative form, to somehow mirror that, given that
    comparatives and superlatives are comparable concepts,
    resulting in: 
<pre>
<a id="e15d12"
name="e15d12">15.12)</a>  xa1=t1 is the best of the set t4 for xa2
        by standard xa3.
</pre>

    <p>The t2 place in ``traji'', normally filled by a property
    abstraction, is replaced by the seltau places, and the t3 place
    specifying the extremum of ``traji'' (whether the most or the
    least, that is) is presumed by default to be ``the most''.</p>

    <p>But the set against which the t1 place of ``traji'' is
    compared is not the t2 place (which would make the place
    structure of ``traji'' fully parallel to that of ``zmadu''),
    but rather the t4 place. Nevertheless, by a special exception
    to the rules of place ordering, the t4 place of ``traji''-based
    lujvo becomes the second place of the lujvo. Some examples:</p>
