    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Selecting places</h3>

    <p>The set of places of an ordinary lujvo are selected from the
    places of its component gismu. More precisely, the places of
    such a lujvo are derived from the set of places of the
    component gismu by eliminating unnecessary places, until just
    enough places remain to give an appropriate meaning to the
    lujvo. In general, including a place makes the concept
    expressed by a lujvo more general; excluding a place makes the
    concept more specific, because omitting the place requires
    assuming a standard value or range of values for it.</p>

    <p>It would be possible to design the place structure of a
    lujvo from scratch, treating it as if it were a gismu, and
    working out what arguments contribute to the notion to be
    expressed by the lujvo. There are two reasons arguing against
    doing so and in favor of the procedure detailed in this
    chapter.</p>

    <p>The first is that it might be very difficult for a hearer or
    reader, who has no preconceived idea of what concept the lujvo
    is intended to convey, to work out what the place structure
    actually is. Instead, he or she would have to make use of a
    lujvo dictionary every time a lujvo is encountered in order to
    work out what a ``se jbopli'' or a ``te klagau'' is. But this
    would mean that, rather than having to learn just the 1300-odd
    gismu place structures, a Lojbanist would also have to learn
    myriads of lujvo place structures with little or no apparent
    pattern or regularity to them. The purpose of the guidelines
    documented in this chapter is to apply regularity and to make
    it conventional wherever possible.</p>

    <p>The second reason is related to the first: if the veljvo of
    the lujvo has not been properly selected, and the places for
    the lujvo are formulated from scratch, then there is a risk
    that some of the places formulated may not correspond to any of
    the places of the gismu used in the veljvo of the lujvo. If
    that is the case --- that is to say, if the lujvo places are
    not a subset of the veljvo gismu places --- then it will be
    very difficult for the hearer or reader to understand what a
    particular place means, and what it is doing in that particular
    lujvo. This is a topic that will be further discussed in <a
    href="s14.html">Section 14</a>.</p>

    <p>However, second-guessing the place structure of the lujvo is
    useful in guiding the process of subsequently eliminating
    places from the veljvo. If the Lojbanist has an idea of what
    the final place structure should look like, he or she should be
    able to pick an appropriate veljvo to begin with, in order to
    express the idea, and then to decide which places are relevant
    or not relevant to expressing that idea.</p>
