    <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. Why have lujvo?</h3>

    <p>The Lojban vocabulary is founded on its list of 1350-plus
    gismu, made up by combining word lists from various sources.
    These gismu are not intended to be either a complete vocabulary
    for the language nor a minimal list of semantic primitives.
    Instead, the gismu list serves as a basis for the creation of
    compound words, or lujvo. The intention is that (except in
    certain semantically broad but shallow fields such as cultures,
    nations, foods, plants, and animals) suitable lujvo can be
    devised to cover the ten million or so concepts expressible in
    all the world's languages taken together. Grammatically, lujvo
    behave just like gismu: they have place structures and function
    as selbri.</p>

    <p>There is a close relationship between lujvo and tanru. In
    fact, lujvo are condensed forms of tanru:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  ti fagri festi
    That is-fire waste.
</pre>
    contains a tanru which can be reduced to the lujvo in: 
<pre>
<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  ti fagyfesti
    That is-fire-waste.
    That is-ashes.
</pre>

    <p>Although the lujvo ``fagyfesti'' is derived from the tanru
    ``fagri festi'', it is not equivalent in meaning to it. In
    particular, ``fagyfesti'' has a distinct place structure of its
    own, not the same as that of ``festi''. (In contrast, the tanru
    does have the same place structure as ``festi''.) The lujvo
    needs to take account of the places of ``fagri'' as well. When
    a tanru is made into a lujvo, there is no equivalent of ``be
    ... bei ... be'o'' (described in <a href="../c5/s1.html">Chapter
    5</a>) to incorporate sumti into the middle of the lujvo.</p>

    <p>So why have lujvo? Primarily to reduce semantic ambiguity.
    On hearing a tanru, there is a burden on the listener to figure
    out what the tanru might mean. Adding further terms to the
    tanru reduces ambiguity in one sense, by providing more
    information; but it increases ambiguity in another sense,
    because there are more and more tanru joints, each with an
    ambiguous significance. Since lujvo, like other brivla, have a
    fixed place structure and a single meaning, encapsulating a
    commonly-used tanru into a lujvo relieves the listener of the
    burden of creative understanding. In addition, lujvo are
    typically shorter than the corresponding tanru.</p>

    <p>There are no absolute laws fixing the place structure of a
    newly created lujvo. The maker must consider the place
    structures of all the components of the tanru and then decide
    which are still relevant and which can be removed. What is said
    in this chapter represents guidelines, presented as one
    possible standard, not necessarily complete, and not the only
    possible standard. There may well be lujvo that are built
    without regard for these guidelines, or in accordance with
    entirely different guidelines, should such alternative
    guidelines someday be developed. The reason for presenting any
    guidelines at all is so that Lojbanists have a starting point
    for deciding on a likely place structure --- one that others
    seeing the same word can also arrive at by similar
    consideration.</p>

    <p>If the tanru includes connective cmavo such as ``bo'',
    ``ke'', ``ke'e'', or ``je'', or conversion or abstraction cmavo
    such as ``se'' or ``nu'', there are ways of incorporating them
    into the lujvo as well. Sometimes this makes the lujvo
    excessively long; if so, the cmavo may be dropped. This leads
    to the possibility that more than one tanru could produce the
    same lujvo. Typically, however, only one of the possible tanru
    is useful enough to justify making a lujvo for it.</p>

    <p>The exact workings of the lujvo-making algorithm, which
    takes a tanru built from gismu (and possibly cmavo) and
    produces a lujvo from it, are described in <a
    href="../c4/s1.html">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
