          <h3>14. Sticky modals</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<pre>
     ki      KI                  stickiness flag
</pre>
</p>

    <p>Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in
    which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this
    “stickiness” is to make the modal, along with its following
    sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive bridi.
    Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not
    any following sumti) with the cmavo “ki” of selma'o KI. For
    example,

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">14.1)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban.
           bai ki tu'a la frank.
       .ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban.
       I speak in-language Lojban
           compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
       Afterward, I speak in-language English.
</pre>

    means the same as:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">14.2)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban.
             bai tu'a la frank.
       .ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban.
             bai tu'a la frank.
       I speak in-language Lojban
             compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
       Afterward, I speak in-language English
             compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
</pre>

    In <a href="../14/#1">Example 14.1</a>, “bai” is made
    sticky, and so Frank’s compelling is made applicable to every
    following bridi. “bau” is not sticky, and so the language may
    vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular
    bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.</p>

    <p>To cancel stickiness, use the form “BAI ki ku”, which
    stops any modal value for the specified BAI from being passed
    to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all modals
    simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist
    (“ki” is used for both modals and tenses), use “ki” by
    itself, either before the selbri or (in the form “ki ku”)
    anywhere in the bridi:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">14.3)</a>  mi ki tavla
       I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).
</pre>

    Note: Modals made with “fi'o”-plus-selbri cannot be made
    sticky. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.</p>
