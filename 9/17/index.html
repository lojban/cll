<h3>17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents</h3>
<p>The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by “se”.</p>
<p>For those cmavo with meaningful “te”, “ve”, and even “xe” conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.</p>

</pre>
<p>The lujvo “tamsmi” on which “tai” is based is derived from the tanru “tarmi simsa” and has the place structure:</p>
<pre>
       tamsmi: x1 has form x2, similar in form to x3 in property/quality x4
</pre>
This lujvo is employed because “tarmi” does not have a place structure useful for the modal’s purpose.
