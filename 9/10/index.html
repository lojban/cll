          <h3>10. Modal relative phrases; Comparison</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     pe      GOI                 restrictive relative phrase
     ne      GOI                 incidental relative phrase
     mau     BAI                 zmadu modal
     me'a    BAI                 mleca modal
</pre>
</p>

    <p>Relative phrases and clauses are explained in much more
    detail in <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>. However, there is
    a construction which combines a modal with a relative phrase
    which is relevant to this chapter. Consider the following
    examples of relative clauses:

<pre>
<a id="1"
name="1">10.1)</a>  la .apasionatas. poi se cusku la .artr. rubnstain.
             cu se nelci mi
       The Appassionata which is-expressed-by Artur Rubenstein
             is-liked-by me.

<a id="2"
name="2">10.2)</a>  la .apasionatas. noi se finti la betovn.
             cu se nelci mi
       The Appassionata, which is-created-by Beethoven,
             is-liked-by me.

</pre>
    In <a href="../10/#1">Example 10.1</a>, “la .apasionatas.”
    refers to a particular performance of the sonata, namely the
    one performed by Rubenstein. Therefore, the relative clause
    “poi se cusku” uses the cmavo “poi” (of selma'o NOI) to
    restrict the meaning of “la .apasionatas” to the performance
    in question.</p>

    <p>In <a href="../10/#2">Example 10.2</a>, however, “la
    .apasionatas.” refers to the sonata as a whole, and the
    information that it was composed by Beethoven is merely
    incidental. The cmavo “noi” (also of selma'o NOI) expresses
    the incidental nature of this relationship.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “pe” and “ne” (of selma'o GOI) are roughly
    equivalent to “poi” and “noi” respectively, but are
    followed by sumti rather than full bridi. We can abbreviate <a
    href="../10/#1">Example 10.1</a> and <a href="../10/#2">Example
    10.2</a> to:

<pre>
<a id="3"
name="3">10.3)</a>  la .apasionatas pe la .artr. rubnstain. se nelci mi
       The Appassionata of Artur Rubenstein is-liked-by me.

<a id="4"
name="4">10.4)</a>  la .apasionatas ne la betovn. se nelci mi
       The Appassionata, which is of Beethoven, is-liked-by me.
</pre>

    Here the precise selbri of the relative clauses is lost: all we
    can tell is that the Appassionata is connected in some way with
    Rubenstein (in <a href="../10/#3">Example 10.3</a>) and Beethoven
    (in <a href="../10/#4">Example 10.4</a>), and that the
    relationships are respectively restrictive and incidental.</p>

    <p>It happens that both “cusku” and “finti” have BAI cmavo,
    namely “cu'u” and “fi'e”. We can recast <a
    href="../10/#3">Example 10.3</a> and <a href="../10/#4">Example
    10.4</a> as:

<pre>
<a id="5"
name="5">10.5)</a>  la .apasionatas pe cu'u la .artr. rubnstain.
             cu se nelci mi
       The Appassionata expressed-by Artur Rubenstein
             is-liked-by me.

<a id="6"
name="6">10.6)</a>  la .apasionatas ne fi'e la betovn.
             cu se nelci mi
       The Appassionata, invented-by Beethoven,
             is-liked-by me.
</pre>

    <a href="../10/#5">Example 10.5</a> and <a href="../10/#6">Example
    10.6</a> have the full semantic content of <a
    href="../10/#1">Example 10.1</a> and <a href="../10/#2">Example
    10.2</a> respectively.</p>

    <p>Modal relative phrases are often used with the BAI cmavo
    “mau” and “me'a”, which are based on the comparative gismu
    “zmadu” (more than) and “mleca” (less than) respectively.
    The place structures are:

<pre>
       zmadu   x1 is more than x2 in property/quantity x3 by amount x4
       mleca   x1 is less than x2 in property/quantity x3 by amount x4
</pre>

    <p>Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
<a id="7"
name="7">10.7)</a>  la frank. nelci la betis. ne semau la meiris.
       Frank likes Betty, which-is more-than Mary.
       Frank likes Betty more than (he likes) Mary.
</pre>

    <a href="../10/#7">Example 10.7</a> requires that Frank likes
    Betty, but adds the information that his liking for Betty
    exceeds his liking for Mary. The modal appears in the form
    “semau” because the x2 place of “zmadu” is the basis for
    comparison: in this case, Frank’s liking for Mary.

<pre>
<a id="8"
name="8">10.8)</a>  la frank. nelci la meiris. ne seme'a la betis.
       Frank likes Mary, which-is less-than Betty.
       Frank likes Mary less than (he likes) Betty.
</pre>

    Here we are told that Frank likes Mary less than he likes
    Betty; the information about the comparison is the same. It
    would be possible to rephrase <a href="../10/#7">Example 10.7</a>
    using “me'a” rather than “semau”, and <a
    href="../10/#8">Example 10.8</a> using “mau” rather than
    “seme'a”, but such usage would be unnecessarily confusing.
    Like many BAI cmavo, “mau” and “me'a” are more useful when
    converted with “se”.</p>

    <p>If the “ne” were omitted in <a href="../10/#7">Example
    10.7</a> and <a href="../10/#8">Example 10.8</a>, the modal sumti
    (“la meiris.” and “la betis.” respectively) would become
    attached to the bridi as a whole, producing a very different
    translation. <a href="../10/#8">Example 10.8</a> would
    become:

<pre>
<a id="9"
name="9">10.9)</a>  la frank. nelci la meiris. seme'a la betis.
       Frank likes Mary is-less-than Betty.
       Frank’s liking Mary is less than Betty.
</pre>

    which compares a liking with a person, and is therefore
    nonsense.</p>

    <p>Pure comparison, which states only the comparative
    information but says nothing about whether Frank actually likes
    either Mary or Betty (he may like neither, but dislike Betty
    less), would be expressed differently, as:

<pre>
<a id="10"
name="10">10.10)</a> le ni la frank. nelci la betis.
             cu zmadu le ni la frank. nelci la meiris.
       The quantity-of Frank’s liking Betty
             is-more-than the quantity-of Frank’s liking Mary.
</pre>

    The mechanisms explained in this section are appropriate to
    many modals other than “semau” and “seme'a”. Some other
    modals that are often associated with relative phrases are:
    “seba'i” (“instead of”), “ci'u” (“on scale”), “de'i”
    (“dated”), “du'i” (“as much as”). Some BAI tags can be
    used equally well in relative phrases or attached to bridi;
    others seem useful only attached to bridi. But it is also
    possible that the usefulness of particular BAI modals is an
    English-speaker bias, and that speakers of other languages may
    find other BAIs useful in divergent ways.</p>

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are
    applicable both to BAI modals and to “fi'o”-plus-selbri
    modals.</p>
