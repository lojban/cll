          <h3>7. Modal sentence connection: the causals</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ri'a    BAI rinka modal: physical cause
    ki'u    BAI krinu modal: justification
    mu'i    BAI mukti modal: motivation
    ni'i    BAI nibli modal: logical entailment
</pre>

    <p>This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains
    the grammatical construct called ``modal sentence connection''.
    On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo:
    the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal
    implications: ``ja'e'' means ``with result'', and so ``seja'e''
    means ``with cause of unspecified nature''; likewise, ``gau''
    means ``with agent'' and ``tezu'e'' means ``with purpose''.
    These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as
    my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than
    Lojbanic views of causation.)</p>

    <p>There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing
    different versions of the relationships lumped in English as
    ``causal'':</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>rinka: event x1 physically causes event x2 krinu: event
      x1 is the justification for event x2 mukti: event x1 is the
      (human) motive for event x2 nibli: event x1 logically entails
      event x2</dd>
    </dl>
    Each of these gismu has a related modal: ``ri'a'', ``ki'u'',
    ``mu'i'', and ``ni'i'' respectively. Using these gismu and
    these modals, we can create various causal sentences with
    different implications: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  le spati cu banro
        ri'a le nu
            do djacu dunda fi le spati
    the plant grows
        with-physical-cause the event-of
            you water give to the plant.
    The plant grows because you water it.

<a id="7-2"
name="7-2">7.2)</a>   la djan. cpacu le pamoi se jinga
        ki'u le nu la djan. jinga
    John gets the first prize
        with-justification the event-of John wins.
    John got the first prize because he won.

<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>   mi lebna le cukta
        mu'i le nu mi viska le cukta
    I took the book
        with-motivation the event-of I saw the book.
    I took the book because I saw it.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">7.4)</a>  la sokrates. morsi binxo
        ni'i le nu la sokrates. remna
    Socrates dead-became
        with-logical-justification Socrates is-human.
    Socrates died because Socrates is human.
</pre>
    In <a href="../7/#1">Examples 7.1</a> through <a
    href="../7/#4">7.4</a>, the same English word ``because'' is used
    to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being
    expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on <a
    href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a>, and explore some variations on
    it. 

    <p>As written, <a href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a> claims that the
    plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an
    abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>) without actually making a
    claim. If I express <a href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a>, I have
    said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you
    actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship
    between watering and growing. This is semantically
    asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was
    being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary
    information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the
    abstraction bridi, saying:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">7.5)</a>  do djacu dunda fi le spati
        seri'a le nu ri banro
    You water-give to the plant
        with-physical-effect it grows.
    You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre>
    with the ``ri'a'' changed to ``seri'a''. In addition, there are
    also symmetrical forms: 
<pre>
<a id="7-6"
name="7-6">7.6)</a>  le nu do djacu dunda fi le spati cu rinka
        le nu le spati cu banro
    The event-of (you water-give to the plant) causes
        the event-of (the plant grows).
    Your watering the plant causes its growth.
    If you water the plant, then it grows.
</pre>
    does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal
    relationship between them. So in <a href="../7/#6">Example
    7.6</a>, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have
    in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a
    form of ``if-then'' in English quite distinct from the logical
    connective ``if-then'' explained in <a
    href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a>. 

    <p>Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal
    relationship? We can use one of two methods:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="7-7"
name="7-7">7.7)</a>  le spati cu banro .iri'abo do djacu dunda fi le spati
    The plant grows.  Because you water-give to the plant.
    The plant grows because you water it.

<a id="8" name="8">7.8)</a>   do djacu dunda fi le spati
        .iseri'abo le spati cu banro
    You water-give to the plant.
        Therefore it grows.
    You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre>

    <p>The compound cmavo ``.iri'abo'' and ``.iseri'abo'' serve to
    connect two bridi, as the initial ``.i'' indicates. The final
    ``bo'' is necessary to prevent the modal from ``taking over''
    the following sumti. If the ``bo'' were omitted from <a
    href="../7/#7">Example 7.7</a> we would have:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">7.9)</a>  le spati cu banro
        .i ri'a do djacu dunda
            fi le spati
    The plant grows.
        Because of you, [something] water-gives
            to the plant.
    The plant grows.  Because of you, water is given
        to the plant.
</pre>

    <p>Because ``ri'a do'' is a modal sumti in <a
    href="../7/#9">Example 7.9</a>, there is no longer an explicit
    sumti in the x1 place of ``djacu dunda'', and the translation
    must be changed.</p>

    <p>The effect of sentences like <a href="../7/#7">Example 7.7</a>
    and <a href="../7/#8">Example 7.8</a> is that the modal, ``ri'a''
    in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead,
    the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi.
    Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first
    bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu ``rinka''; it specifies
    an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three
    things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and
    that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the
    two.</p>

    <p>In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence
    connective of the type exemplified by <a href="../7/#7">Example
    7.7</a> and <a href="../7/#8">Example 7.8</a>. However, it makes
    little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or
    other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding
    gismu. The sentence connective ``.ibaubo'' is perfectly
    grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which
    could be connected by an ``in-language'' modal. This is because
    a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or
    an effect, but not a language.</p>
