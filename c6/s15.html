          <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Number summary</h3>

    <p>The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo ``li''
    (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or
    mathematical expression. This can be anything from a simple
    number up to the most complicated combination of numbers,
    variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on
    numbers is given in <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>. Here
    are a few examples of increasing complexity:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d1" name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    li vo
    the-number four
    4

<a id="e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a> li re su'i re
    the-number two plus two
    2 + 2

<a id="e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a> li .abu bopi'i xy. bote'a re
        su'i by. bopi'i xy. su'i cy.
    the-number a times x to-power 2
        plus b times x plus c
    ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c
</pre>
    An alternative to ``li'' is ``me'o'', also of selma'o LI.
    Number expressions beginning with ``me'o'' refer to the actual
    expression, rather than its value. Thus <a
    href="#e15d1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="#e15d2">Example
    15.2</a> above have the same meaning, the number four, whereas 
<pre>
<a id="e15d4" name="e15d4">15.4)</a>    me'o vo
    the-expression four
    ``4''
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e15d5" name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    me'o re su'i re
    the-expression two plus two
    ``2+2''
</pre>
    refer to different pieces of text. 

    <p>The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical
    expressions is ``su'o'', because these sumti are analogous to
    ``lo'' descriptions: they refer to things which actually are
    numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with
    ``li''), this is a distinction without a difference, as there
    is only one number which is 4; but there are many texts ``4'',
    as many as there are documents in which that numeral
    appears.</p>
