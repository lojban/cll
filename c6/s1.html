<h2>Chapter 6<br />
      To Speak Of Many Things: The Lojban sumti</h2>
          <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. The five kinds of simple sumti</h3>

    <p>If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a
    sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that
    fills the places of simple Lojban sentences like:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the market
</pre>
    In <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>, ``mi'' and ``le zarci'' are
    the sumti. It is easy to see that these two sumti are not of
    the same kind: ``mi'' is a pro-sumti (the Lojban analogue of a
    pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas ``le zarci'' is a
    description which refers to something described as being a
    market. 

    <p>There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>descriptions like ``le zarci'', which usually begin with
      a descriptor (called a ``gadri'' in Lojban) such as
      ``le'';</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>pro-sumti, such as ``mi'';</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>names, such as ``la lojban.'', which usually begin with
      ``la'';</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>quotations, which begin with ``lu'', ``le'u'', ``zo'', or
      ``zoi'';</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>pure numbers, which usually begin with ``li''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Here are a few examples of each kind of sumti:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  e'osai ko sarji la lojban.
    Please support Lojban!
</pre>
    <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> exhibits ``ko'', a pro-sumti;
    and ``la lojban.'', a name. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  mi cusku lu e'osai li'u le tcidu
    I express ``Please!'' to-the reader.
</pre>
    <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a> exhibits ``mi'', a pro-sumti;
    ``lu e'osai li'u'', a quotation; and ``le tcidu'', a
    description. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  ti mitre li ci
    This measures-in-meters the-number three.
    This is three meters long.
</pre>
    <a href="#e1d4">Example 1.4</a> exhibits ``ti'', a pro-sumti;
    and ``li ci'', a number. 

    <p>Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the
    most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given
    to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions.
    Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail
    in <a href="../c7/s1.html">Chapter 7</a>, <a
    href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>, and <a
    href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter 19</a> respectively, so this chapter
    only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See <a
    href="#s13">Section 13</a> through <a href="s15.html">Section
    15</a> for these summaries.</p>
