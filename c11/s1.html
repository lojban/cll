    <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. The syntax of abstraction</h3>

    <p>The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as
    ``abstraction'' is to provide a means for taking whole bridi
    and packaging them up, as it were, into simple selbri.
    Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform;
    semantically, they are rich and complex, with few features in
    common between one variety of abstraction and another. We will
    begin by discussing syntax without regard to semantics; as a
    result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at
    first. Bear with this difficulty until <a href="s2.html">Section
    2</a>.</p>

    <p>An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and
    preceding it by any cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such
    cmavo; they are known as ``abstractors''. The bridi is closed
    by the elidable terminator ``kei'', of selma'o KEI. Thus, to
    change the bridi</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the store
</pre>
    into an abstraction using ``nu'', one of the members of selma'o
    NU, we change it into 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  nu mi klama le zarci [kei]
    an-event-of my going-to the store
</pre>
    The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated
    sumti, as here. It is important to beware of eliding ``kei''
    improperly, as many of the common uses of abstraction selbri
    involve following them with words that would appear to be part
    of the abstraction if ``kei'' had been elided. 

    <p>(Technically, ``kei'' is never necessary, because the
    elidable terminator ``vau'' that closes every bridi can
    substitute for it; however, ``kei'' is specific to
    abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)</p>

    <p>The grammatical uses of an abstraction selbri are exactly
    the same as those of a simple brivla. In particular,
    abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in <a
    href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a>, or used in tanru:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  la djan. cu nu sonci kei djica
    John is-an-(event-of being-a-soldier) type-of desirer.
    John wants to be a soldier.
</pre>
    Abstraction selbri may also be used in descriptions, preceded
    by ``le'' (or any other member of selma'o LE): 
<pre>
<a id="e1d4"
name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  la djan. cu djica le nu sonci [kei]
    John desires the event-of being-a-soldier.
</pre>

    <p>We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction
    either at the end of a bridi, or just before the main selbri
    with its ``cu''; in either of these circumstances, ``kei'' can
    normally be elided.</p>

    <p>The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the
    particular abstractor, and will be explained individually in
    the following sections.</p>

    <p>Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the
    grammatical form used in the English changes. Thus, in the
    gloss of <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> we see ``my going-to
    the store'' rather than ``I go-to the store''; likewise, in the
    glosses of <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a> and <a
    href="#e1d4">Example 1.4</a> we see ``being-a-soldier'' rather
    than ``is-a-soldier''. This procedure reflects the desire for
    more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change
    in the Lojban form. A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change
    when it is used as part of an abstraction selbri.</p>
