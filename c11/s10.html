    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. Lojban sumti raising</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   tu'a    LAhE    an abstraction involving
    jai JAI abstraction conversion
</pre>
    It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract
    description is logically required, to express the abstraction.
    In English we can say: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    I try to open the door.
</pre>
    which in Lojban is: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi troci le nu
        [mi] gasnu le nu
            le vorme cu karbi'o
    I try the event-of
        (I am-agent-in the event-of
            (the door open-becomes)).
</pre>
    which has an abstract description within an abstract
    description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in
    all other languages), we may also say: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    I try the door.
</pre>
    where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door
    itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can
    be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a
    cmavo. The relevant cmavo is ``tu'a'', which belongs to selma'o
    LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of <a href="#e10d3">Example
    10.3</a> is: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi troci tu'a le vorme
    I try some-action-to-do-with the door.
</pre>
    The term ``sumti-raising'', as in the title of this section,
    signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an
    abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself
    inside an intermediate abstraction) is ``raised'' to the main
    bridi level. This transformation from <a href="#e10d2">Example
    10.2</a> to <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> loses
    information: nothing except convention tells us what the
    abstraction was. 

    <p>Using ``tu'a'' is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking
    easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The
    speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something
    like:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    tu'a le vorme lu'u ki'a
    something-to-do-with the door [terminator] [confusion!]
</pre>
    which indicates that ``tu'a le vorme'' cannot be understood.
    (The terminator for ``tu'a'' is ``lu'u'', and is used in <a
    href="#e10d5">Example 10.5</a> to make clear just what is being
    questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word ``vorme''
    as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    tu'a la djan. cu cafne
    something-to-do-with John frequently-occurs
</pre>

    <p>This must mean that something which John does, or which
    happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context
    there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the
    ``tu'a'', <a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a> would mean that
    John considered as an event frequently occurs --- in other
    words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence!
    Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but
    the x1 place of ``cafne'' is an event, and if something that
    does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic
    listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this
    analysis assumes that ``djan.'' is the name of a person, and
    not the name of some event.)</p>

    <p>Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to ``tu'a''
    which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is
    achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo ``jai'' (of selma'o
    JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a> and <a
    href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a>; for the purposes of this
    chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to
    the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    tu'a mi rinka
        le nu do morsi
    something-to-do-with me causes
        the event-of you are-dead
    My action causes your death.
</pre>
    into 
<pre>
<a id="e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
    I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
    I cause your death.
</pre>

    <p>In English, the subject of ``cause'' can either be the
    actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a
    person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of ``rinka''
    is always an event. <a href="#e10d7">Example 10.7</a> and <a
    href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> look equally convenient (or
    inconvenient), but in making descriptions, <a
    href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> can be altered to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    le jai rinka
        be le nu do morsi
    that-which-is associated-with causing
        (the event-of your death)
    the one who caused your death
</pre>
    because ``jai'' modifies the selbri and can be incorporated
    into the description --- not so for ``tu'a''. 

    <p>The weakness of ``jai'' used in descriptions in this way is
    that it does not specify which argument of the implicit
    abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the
    description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal
    form of ``jai'' explained in <a href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter
    9</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  le jai gau rinka
        be le nu do morsi
    that-which-is agent-in causing
        (the event-of your death)
</pre>
