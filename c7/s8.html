    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Reflexive and reciprocal pro-sumti: the vo'a-series</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   vo'a    KOhA    vo'a-series x1 of this bridi
    vo'e    KOhA    vo'a-series x2 of this bridi
    vo'i    KOhA    vo'a-series x3 of this bridi
    vo'o    KOhA    vo'a-series x4 of this bridi
    vo'u    KOhA    vo'a-series x5 of this bridi
    soi SOI         reciprocity
    se'u    SEhU            soi terminator
</pre>
    The cmavo of the vo'a-series are pro-sumti anaphora, like those
    of the ri-series, but have a specific function. These cmavo
    refer to the other places of the same bridi; the five of them
    represent up to five places. The same vo'a-series cmavo mean
    different things in different bridi. Some examples: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi lumci vo'a
    I wash myself
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  mi klama le zarci vo'e
    I go to the store from itself
        [by some route unspecified].
</pre>
    To refer to places of neighboring bridi, constructions like
    ``le se go'i ku'' do the job: this refers to the 2nd place of
    the previous main bridi, as explained in <a href="s6.html">Section
    6</a>. 

    <p>The cmavo of the vo'a-series are also used with ``soi'' (of
    selma'o SOI) to precisely express reciprocity, which in English
    is imprecisely expressed with a discursive phrase like ``vice
    versa'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi prami do
        soi vo'a vo'e
    I love you
        [reciprocity] [x1 of this bridi]
        [x2 of this bridi].
    I love you and vice versa (swapping ``I'' and ``you'').
</pre>
    The significance of ``soi vo'a vo'e'' is that the bridi is
    still true even if the x1 (specified by ``vo'a'') and the x2
    (specified by ``vo'e'') places are interchanged. If only a
    single sumti follows ``soi'', then the sumti immediately
    preceding ``soi'' is understood to be one of those involved: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  mi prami do soi vo'a
    I love you [reciprocity] [x1 of this bridi].
</pre>
    again involves the x1 and x2 places. 

    <p>Of course, other places can be involved, and other sumti may
    be used in place of vo'a-series cmavo, provided those other
    sumti can be reasonably understood as referring to the same
    things mentioned in the bridi proper. Here are several examples
    that mean the same thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi bajra ti ta soi vo'e
    mi bajra ti ta soi vo'e vo'i
    soi vo'e vo'i mi bajra ti ta
    I run to this from that and vice versa
        (to that from this).
</pre>
    The elidable terminator for ``soi'' is ``se'u'' (selma'o SEhU),
    which is normally needed only if there is just one sumti after
    the ``soi'', and the ``soi'' construction is not at the end of
    the bridi. Constructions using ``soi'' are free modifiers, and
    as such can go almost anywhere. Here is an example where
    ``se'u'' is required: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  mi bajykla ti
        soi vo'i se'u ta
    I runningly-go to-this
        [reciprocity] [x3 of this bridi] from-that
    I run to this from that and vice versa.
</pre>
