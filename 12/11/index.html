          <h3>11. Eliding KE and KEhE rafsi from lujvo</h3>

    <p>People constructing lujvo usually want them to be as short
    as possible. To that end, they will discard any cmavo they
    regard as niceties. The first such cmavo to get thrown out are
    usually “ke” and “ke'e”, the cmavo used to structure and
    group tanru. We can usually get away with this, because the
    interpretation of the tertau with “ke” and “ke'e” missing
    is less plausible than that with the cmavo inserted, or because
    the distinction isn’t really important.</p>

    <p>For example, in “bakrecpa'o”, meaning “beefsteak”, the
    veljvo is</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-1"
name="11-1">11.1)</a>    [ke] bakni rectu [ke'e] panlo
    ( bovine meat ) slice
</pre>
    because of the usual Lojban left-grouping rule. But there
    doesn’t seem to be much difference between that veljvo and 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">11.2)</a>    bakni ke rectu panlo [ke'e]
    bovine ( meat slice )
</pre>
    On the other hand, the lujvo “zernerkla”, meaning “to sneak
    in”, almost certainly was formed from the veljvo 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">11.3)</a>    zekri ke nenri klama [ke'e]
    crime ( inside go )
    to go within, criminally
</pre>
    because the alternative, 
<pre>
<a id="11-4"
name="11-4">11.4)</a>    [ke] zekri nenri [ke'e] klama
    (crime inside) go
</pre>
    doesn’t make much sense. (To go to the inside of a crime? To go
    into a place where it is criminal to be inside --- an
    interpretation almost identical with <a href="../11/#3">Example
    11.3</a> anyway?) 

    <p>There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi
    can produce another lujvo, equally useful. For example,
    “xaskemcakcurnu” means “oceanic shellfish”, and has the
    veljvo</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">11.5)</a>    xamsi ke calku curnu
    ocean type-of (shell worm)
</pre>
    (“worm” in Lojban refers to any invertebrate), but
    “xascakcurnu” has the veljvo 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-6"
name="11-6">11.6)</a>    [ke] xamsi calku [ke'e] curnu
    (ocean shell) type-of worm
</pre>
    and might refer to the parasitic worms that infest clamshells. 

    <p>Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo
    starting with “sel-” (from “se”), “nal-” (from “na'e”)
    or “tol-” (from “to'e”): the scope of the rafsi will
    likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of
    these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or “ke
    ... ke'e” group. For that reason, if we want to modify an
    entire lujvo by putting “se”, “na'e” or “to'e” before it,
    it’s better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert
    “ke”, than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.</p>

    <p>It is all right to replace the phrase “se klama” with
    “selkla”, and the places of “selkla” are exactly those of
    “se klama”. But consider the related lujvo “dzukla”,
    meaning “to walk to somewhere”. It is a symmmetrical lujvo,
    derived from the veljvo “cadzu klama” as follows:</p>
<pre>
<a id="11-7"
name="11-7">11.7)</a>    “cadzu”: c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
    “klama”: k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
    “dzukla”: c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4
        using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2
</pre>

    <p>We can swap the k1 and k2 places using “se dzukla”, but we
    cannot directly make “se dzukla” into “seldzukla”, which
    would represent the veljvo “selcadzu klama” and plausibly
    mean something like “to go to a walking surface”. Instead, we
    would need “selkemdzukla”, with an explicit rafsi for “ke”.
    Similarly, “nalbrablo” (from “na'e barda bloti”) means
    “non-big boat”, whereas “na'e brablo” means “other than a
    big boat”.</p>

    <p>If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already
    starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance,
    “gekmau” means “happier than”, while “selgekmau” means
    “making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a
    ’se gleki’ than”. If something is less enjoyable than
    something else, we can say it is “se selgekmau”.</p>

    <p>But we can also say it is “selselgekmau”. Two “se” cmavo
    in a row cancel each other (“se se gleki” means the same as
    just “gleki”), so there would be no good reason to have
    “selsel” in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel
    free to interpret “selsel-” as “selkemsel-”. The rafsi
    combinations “terter-”, “velvel-” and “xelxel-” work in
    the same way.</p>

    <p>Other SE combinations like “selter-”, although they might
    conceivably mean “se te”, more than likely should be
    interpreted in the same way, namely as “se ke te”, since
    there is no need to re-order places in the way that “se te”
    provides. (See <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>
