          <h3>3. The meaning of lujvo</h3>

    <p>This is a fairly long way to go to try and work out how to
    say “doghouse”! The reader can take heart; we’re nearly
    there. Recall that one of the components involved in fixing the
    meaning of a tanru --- the one left deliberately vague --- is
    the precise relation between the tertau and the seltau. Indeed,
    fixing this relation is tantamount to giving an interpretation
    to the ambiguous tanru.</p>

    <p>A lujvo is defined by a single disambiguated instance of a
    tanru. That is to say, when we try to design the place
    structure of a lujvo, we don’t need to try to discover the
    relation between the tertau and the seltau. We already know
    what kind of relation we’re looking for; it’s given by the
    specific need we wish to express, and it determines the place
    structure of the lujvo itself.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to simply devise
    lujvo and decide on place structures for them without
    considering one or more specific usages for the coinage. If one
    does not consider specifics, one will be likely to make
    erroneous generalizations on the relationship r.</p>

    <p>The insight driving the rest of this chapter is this: while
    the relation expressed by a tanru can be very distant (e.g.
    Spot chasing Socks, above), the relationship singled out for
    disambiguation in a lujvo should be quite close. This is
    because lujvo-making, paralleling natural language compounding,
    picks out the most salient relationship r between a tertau
    place and a seltau place to be expressed in a single word. The
    relationship “dog chases cat owned by daughter of person
    living in house” is too distant, and too incidental, to be
    likely to need expression as a single short word; the
    relationship “dog lives in house” is not. From all the
    various interpretations of “gerku zdani”, the person creating
    “gerzda” should pick the most useful value of r. The most
    useful one is usually going to be the most obvious one, and the
    most obvious one is usually the closest one.</p>

    <p>In fact, the relationship will almost always be so close
    that the predicate expressing r will be either the seltau or
    the tertau predicate itself. This should come as no surprise,
    given that a word like “zdani” in Lojban is a predicate.
    Predicates express relations; so when you’re looking for a
    relation to tie together “le zdani” and “le gerku”, the
    most obvious relation to pick is the very relation named by the
    tertau, “zdani”: the relation between a home and its dweller.
    As a result, the object which fills the first place of
    “gerku” (the dog) also fills the second place of “zdani”
    (the house-dweller).</p>

    <p>The seltau-tertau relationship in the veljvo is expressed by
    the seltau or tertau predicate itself. Therefore, at least one
    of the seltau places is going to be equivalent to a tertau
    place. This place is thus redundant, and can be dropped from
    the place structure of the lujvo. As a corollary, the precise
    relationship between the veljvo components can be implicitly
    determined by finding one or more places to overlap in this
    way.</p>

    <p>So what is the place structure of “gerzda”? We’re left
    with three places, since the dweller, the “se zdani”, turned
    out to be identical to the dog, the “gerku”. We can proceed
    as follows:</p>

    <p>(The notation introduced casually in <a href=../2/>Section
    2</a> will be useful in the rest of this chapter. Rather than
    using the regular x1, x2, etc. to represent places, we’ll use
    the first letter of the relevant gismu in place of the “x”,
    or more than one letter where necessary to resolve ambiguities.
    Thus, z1 is the first place of “zdani”, and g2 is the second
    place of “gerku”.)</p>

    <p>The place structure of “zdani” is given as <a
    href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>, but is repeated here using the
    new notation:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3-1"
name="3-1">3.1)</a>  z1 is a nest/house/lair/den of z2
</pre>

    <p>The place structure of “gerku” is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>  g1 is a dog of breed g2
</pre>

    <p>But z2 is the same as g1; therefore, the tentative place
    structure for “gerzda” now becomes:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3-3"
name="3-3">3.3)</a>  z1 is a house for dweller z2 of breed g2
</pre>
    which can also be written 
<pre>
<a id="3-4"
name="3-4">3.4)</a>  z1 is a house for dog g1 of breed g2
</pre>
    or more concisely 
<pre>
<a id="3-5"
name="3-5">3.5)</a>  z1 is a house for dweller/dog z2=g1 of breed g2
</pre>

    <p>Despite the apparently conclusive nature of <a
    href="../3/#5">Example 3.5</a>, our task is not yet done: we
    still need to decide whether any of the remaining places should
    also be eliminated, and what order the lujvo places should
    appear in. These concerns will be addressed in the remainder of
    the chapter; but we are now equipped with the terminology
    needed for those discussions.</p>
