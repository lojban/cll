          <h3>12. Abstract lujvo</h3>

    <p>The cmavo of NU can participate in the construction of lujvo
    of a particularly simple and well-patterned kind. Consider that
    old standard example, ``klama'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-1"
name="12-1">12.1)</a>    k1 comes/goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5.
</pre>

    <p>The selbri ``nu klama [kei]'' has only one place, the
    event-of-going, but the full five places exist implicitly
    between ``nu'' and ``kei'', since a full bridi with all sumti
    may be placed there. In a lujvo, there is no room for such
    inside places, and consequently the lujvo ``nunkla'' (``nun-''
    is the rafsi for ``nu''), needs to have six places:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-2"
name="12-2">12.2)</a>    nu1 is the event of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3
        via route k4 by means k5.
</pre>

    <p>Here the first place of ``nunklama'' is the first and only
    place of ``nu'', and the other five places have been pushed
    down by one to occupy the second through the sixth places. Full
    information on ``nu'', as well as the other abstractors
    mentioned in this section, is given in <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>.</p>

    <p>For those abstractors which have a second place as well, the
    standard convention is to place this place after, rather than
    before, the places of the brivla being abstracted. The place
    structure of ``nilkla'', the lujvo derived from ``ni klama'',
    is the imposing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-3"
name="12-3">12.3)</a>    ni1 is the amount of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3
        via route k4 by means k5, measured on scale ni2.
</pre>

    <p>It is not uncommon for abstractors to participate in the
    making of more complex lujvo as well. For example,
    ``nunsoidji'', from the veljvo</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">12.4)</a>    nu sonci kei djica
    event-of being-a-soldier desirer
</pre>
    has the place structure 
<pre>
<a id="12-5"
name="12-5">12.5)</a>    d1 desires the event of (s1 being a soldier of army s2)
        for purpose d3
</pre>
    where the d2 place has disappeared altogether, being replaced
    by the places of the seltau. As shown in <a
    href="../12/#5">Example 12.5</a>, the ordering follows this idea
    of replacement: the seltau places are inserted at the point
    where the omitted abstraction place exists in the tertau. 

    <p>The lujvo ``nunsoidji'' is quite different from the ordinary
    asymmetric lujvo ``soidji'', a ``soldier desirer'', whose place
    structure is just</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-6"
name="12-6">12.6)</a>    d1 desires (a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
</pre>

    <p>A ``nunsoidji'' might be someone who is about to enlist,
    whereas a ``soidji'' might be a camp-follower.</p>

    <p>One use of abstract lujvo is to eliminate the need for
    explicit ``kei'' in tanru: ``nunkalri gasnu'' means much the
    same as ``nu kalri kei gasnu'', but is shorter. In addition,
    many English words ending in ``-hood'' are represented with
    ``nun-'' lujvo, and other words ending in ``-ness'' or ``-dom''
    are often representable with ``kam-'' lujvo (``kam-'' is the
    rafsi for ``ka''); ``kambla'' is ``blueness''.</p>

    <p>Even though the cmavo of NU are long-scope in nature,
    governing the whole following bridi, the NU rafsi should
    generally be used as short-scope modifiers, like the SE and
    NAhE rafsi discussed in <a href=../9/>Section 9</a>.</p>

    <p>There is also a rafsi for the cmavo ``jai'', namely ``jax'',
    which allows sentences like</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">12.7)</a>    mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
    I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
    I cause your death.
</pre>
    explained in <a href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>, to be
    rendered with lujvo: 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">12.8)</a>    mi jaxri'a le nu do morsi
    I am-part-of-the-cause-of the event-of your dying.
</pre>
    In making a lujvo that contains ``jax-'' for a selbri that
    contains ``jai'', the rule is to leave the ``fai'' place as a
    ``fai'' place of the lujvo; it does not participate in the
    regular lujvo place structure. (The use of ``fai'' is also
    explained in <a href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>.)
