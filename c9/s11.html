    <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">11. Mixed modal connection</h3>

    <p>It is possible to mix logical connection (explained in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>) with modal connection, in a
    way that simultaneously asserts the logical connection and the
    modal relationship. Consider the sentences:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d1"
name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    mi nelci do .ije mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  And I like Jane
</pre>
    which is a logical connection, and 
<pre>
<a id="e11d2"
name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    mi nelci do .iki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  Justified-by I like Jane.
</pre>
    The meanings of <a href="#e11d1">Example 11.1</a> and <a
    href="#e11d2">Example 11.2</a> can be simultaneously expressed
    by combining the two compound cmavo, thus: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d3"
name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    mi nelci do .ijeki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  And justified-by I like Jane.
</pre>
    Here the two sentences ``mi nelci do'' and ``mi nelci la
    djein.'' are simultaneously asserted, their logical connection
    is asserted, and their causal relationship is asserted. The
    logical connective ``je'' comes before the modal ``ki'u'' in
    all such mixed connections. 

    <p>Since ``mi nelci do'' and ``mi nelci la djein.'' differ only
    in the final sumti, we can transform <a href="#e11d3">Example
    11.3</a> into a mixed sumti connection:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d4"
name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    mi nelci do .eki'ubo la djein.
    I like you and/because Jane.
</pre>
    Note that this connection is an afterthought one. Mixed
    connectives are always afterthought; forethought connectives
    must be either logical or modal. 

    <p>There are numerous other afterthought logical and
    non-logical connectives that can have modal information planted
    within them. For example, a bridi-tail connected version of <a
    href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d5"
name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    mi nelci do gi'eki'ubo nelci la djein.
    I like you and/because like Jane.
</pre>

    <p>The following three complex examples all mean the same
    thing.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    mi bevri le dakli
        .ijeseri'abo tu'e mi bevri le gerku
        .ijadu'ibo mi bevri le mlatu [tu'u]
    I carry the sack.
        And [effect] (I carry the dog
        And/or [equal] I carry the cat. )
    I carry the sack.
        As a result I carry the dog
        or I carry the cat, equally.

<a id="e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a> mi bevri le dakli
        gi'eseri'ake bevri le gerku
        gi'adu'ibo bevri le mlatu [ke'e]
    I carry the sack
        and [effect] (carry the dog
        and/or [equal] carry the cat ).
    I carry the sack
        and as a result carry the dog or carry the cat equally.

<a id="e11d8" name="e11d8">11.8)</a> mi bevri le dakli
        .eseri'ake le gerku
            .adu'ibo le mlatu [ke'e]
    I carry the sack
        and [effect] (the cat
            and/or [equal] the dog ).
    I carry the sack, and as a result the cat
        or the dog equally.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e11d6">Example 11.6</a>, the ``tu'e ... tu'u''
    brackets are the equivalent of the ``ke ... ke'e'' brackets in
    <a href="#e11d7">Example 11.7</a> and <a href="#e11d8">Example
    11.8</a>, because ``ke ... ke'e'' cannot extend across more
    than one sentence. It would also be possible to change the
    ``.ijeseri'abo'' to ``.ije seri'a'', which would show that the
    ``tu'e ... tu'u'' portion was an effect, but would not pin down
    the ``mi bevri le dakli'' portion as the cause. It is legal for
    a modal (or a tense; see <a href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>)
    to modify the whole of a ``tu'e ... tu'u'' construct. 

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are
    applicable both to BAI modals and to ``fi'o''-plus-selbri
    modals.</p>
