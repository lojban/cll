          <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Modal selbri</h3>

    <p>Consider the example:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban.
        bai tu'a la frank.
    I speak in-language Lojban
        with-compeller some-property-of Frank.
    I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.
</pre>
    <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> has two modal sumti, using the
    modals ``bau'' and ``bai''. Suppose we wanted to specify the
    language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the
    compelling. We can simplify <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> to:
    

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d2"
name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban. bai [ku].
    I speak in-language Lojban under-compulsion.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, the elidable terminator
    ``ku'' has taken the place of the sumti which would normally
    follow ``bai''. Alternatively, we could specify the one who
    compels but keep the language vague:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  mi tavla bau [ku]
        bai tu'a la frank.
    I speak in-some-language
        under-compulsion-by some-property-of Frank.
</pre>

    <p>We are also free to move the modal-plus-``ku'' around the
    bridi:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  bau [ku] bai ku mi tavla
    In-some-language under-compulsion I speak.
</pre>
    An alternative to using ``ku'' is to place the modal cmavo
    right before the selbri, following the ``cu'' which often
    appears there. When a modal is present, the ``cu'' is almost
    never necessary. 
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  mi bai tavla bau la lojban.
    I compelledly speak in-language Lojban.
</pre>
    In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically,
    although grammatically it is quite distinct. <a
    href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> is very similar in meaning to: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi se bapli tavla bau la lojban.
    I compelledly-speak in-language Lojban.
</pre>

    <p>The ``se'' conversion is needed because ``bapli tavla''
    would be a compeller type of speaker rather than a compelled
    (by someone) type of speaker, which is what a ``bai tavla''
    is.</p>

    <p>If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using
    ``fi'o'', then ``fe'u'' is required to prevent the main selbri
    and the modal selbri from colliding:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  mi fi'o kanla fe'u viska do
    I with-eye see you
    I see you with my eye(s).
</pre>
    There are two other uses of modals. A modal can
    be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been
    connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see
    <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a> for more on logical and
    non-logical connections): 
<pre>
<a id="e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi bai
        ke ge klama le zarci gi cadzu le bisli [ke'e]
    I under-compulsion
        ( both go to-the market and walk on-the ice )
    Under compulsion, I both go to the market
        and walk on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ``bai'' is spread over both ``klama le zarci'' and
    ``cadzu le bisli'', and the ``ge ... gi'' represents the
    logical connection ``both-and'' between the two.</p>

    <p> Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that
    have been combined with ``tu'e'' and ``tu'u'', which are explained
    in more detail in <a href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter 19</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  bai tu'e mi klama le zarci
        .i mi cadzu le bisli [tu'u]
    Under-compulsion [start] I go to-the market.
        I walk on-the ice [end]
</pre>
    means the same thing as <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a>. 

    <p>Note: Either BAI modals or ``fi'o''-plus-selbri modals may
    correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this
    section.</p>
