          <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Logical and non-logical connection of modals</h3>

    <p>Logical and non-logical connectives are explained in detail
    in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>. For the purposes of
    this chapter, it suffices to point out that a logical (or
    non-logical) connection between two bridi which differ only in
    a modal can be reduced to a single bridi with a connective
    between the modals. As a result, <a href="#e15d1">Example
    15.1</a> and <a href="#e15d2">Example 15.2</a> mean the same
    thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d1"
name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani
        .ije la frank. bajra teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination the house.
        And Frank runs with-origin the house.
    Frank runs to the house, and Frank runs from the house.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e15d2"
name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a je teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination and with-origin the house.
    Frank runs to and from the house.
</pre>
    Neither example implies whether a single act, or two acts, of
    running is referred to. To compel the sentence to refer to a
    single act of running, you can use the form: 
<pre>
<a id="e15d3"
name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani
        ce'e teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination the house
        [joined-to] with-origin the-house.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``ce'e'' creates a termset containing two terms
    (termsets are explained in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>
    and <a href="../c16/s1.html">Chapter 16</a>). When a termset
    contains more than one modal tag derived from a single BAI, the
    convention is that the two tags are derived from a common
    event.</p>
