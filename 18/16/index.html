          <h3><a id="16" name="16">16. Reverse Polish notation</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   fu'a    FUhA    reverse Polish flag
</pre>
    So far, the Lojban notational conventions have mapped fairly
    familiar kinds of mathematical discourse. The use of
    forethought operators may have seemed odd when applied to
    ``+'', but when applied to ``f('' they appear as the usual
    functional notation. Now comes a sharp break. Reverse Polish
    (RP) notation represents something completely different; even
    mathematicians don't use it much. (The only common uses of RP,
    in fact, are in some kinds of calculators and in the
    implementation of some programming languages.) 

    <p>In RP notation, the operator follows the operands. (Polish
    notation, where the operator precedes its operands, is another
    name for forethought mekso of the kind explained in <a
    href=../6/>Section 6</a>.) The number of operands per operator
    is always fixed. No parentheses are required or permitted. In
    Lojban, RP notation is always explicitly marked by a ``fu'a''
    at the beginning of the expression; there is no terminator.
    Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">16.1)</a>    li fu'a reboi ci su'i
        du li mu
    the-number (RP!) two, three, plus
        equals the-number five.
</pre>

    <p>The operands are ``re'' and ``ci''; the operator is
    ``su'i''.</p>

    <p>Here is a more complex example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">16.2)</a>    li fu'a reboi ci pi'i
        voboi mu pi'i su'i
        du li rexa
    the-number (RP!) (two, three, times),
        (four, five, times), plus
        equals the-number two-six
</pre>

    <p>Here the operands of the first ``pi'i'' are ``re'' and
    ``ci''; the operands of the second ``pi'i'' are ``vo'' and
    ``mu'' (with ``boi'' inserted where needed), and the operands
    of the ``su'i'' are ``reboi ci pi'i'', or 6, and ``voboi mu
    pi'i'', or 20. As you can see, it is easy to get lost in the
    world of reverse Polish notation; on the other hand, it is
    especially easy for a mechanical listener (who has a deep
    mental stack and doesn't get lost) to comprehend.</p>

    <p>The operands of an RP operator can be any legal mekso
    operand, including parenthesized mekso that can contain any
    valid syntax, whether more RP or something more
    conventional.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, RP operators are always parsed with exactly two
    operands. What about operators which require only one operand,
    or more than two operands? The null operand ``tu'o'' and the
    null operator ``ge'a'' provide a simple solution. A one-operand
    operator like ``va'a'' always appears in a reverse Polish
    context as ``tu'o va'a''. The ``tu'o'' provides the second
    operand, which is semantically ignored but grammatically
    necessary. Likewise, the three-operand version of ``gei''
    appears in reverse Polish as ``ge'a gei'', where the ``ge'a''
    effectively merges the 2nd and 3rd operands into a single
    operand. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">16.3)</a>    li fu'a ciboi muboi vu'u
        du li fu'a reboi tu'o va'a
    The-number (RP!) (three, five, minus)
        equals the-number (RP!) two, null, negative-of.
    3 - 5 = -2

<a id="4" name="4">16.4)</a> li cinoki'oki'o du
        li fu'a biboi
        ciboi panoboi ge'a gei
    the-number 30-comma-comma equals
        the-number (RP!) 8,
        (3, 10, null-op), exponential-notation
    30,000,000 = 3 &times; 10<sup>8</sup>
</pre>
