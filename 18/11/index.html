<h3>11. Special mekso selbri</h3>
<p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     mei     MOI     cardinal selbri
     moi     MOI     ordinal selbri
     si'e    MOI     portion selbri
     cu'o    MOI     probability selbri
     va'e    MOI     scale selbri

     me      ME      make sumti into selbri

     me'u    MEhU    terminator for ME
</pre>
<p>Lojban possesses a special category of selbri which are based on mekso. The simplest kind of such selbri are made by suffixing a member of selma'o MOI to a number. There are five members of MOI, each of which serves to create number-based selbri with specific place structures.</p>
<p>The cmavo “mei” creates cardinal selbri. The basic place structure is:</p>
<pre>
       x1 is a mass formed from the set x2 of n members, one or more of which is/are x3
</pre>
A cardinal selbri interrelates a set with a given number of members, the mass formed from that set, and the individuals which make the set up. The mass argument is placed first as a matter of convenience, not logical necessity.
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">11.1)</a>  lei mi ratcu cu cimei
       Those-I-describe-as-the-mass-of my rats are-a-threesome.
       My rats are three.
       I have three rats.
</pre>
Here, the mass of my rats is said to have three components; that is, I have three rats.
<p>Another example, with one element this time:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">11.2)</a>  mi poi pamei cu cusku dei
       I who am-an-individual express this-sentence.
</pre>
In <a href="../11/#e2">Example 11.2</a>, “mi” refers to a mass, “the mass consisting of me”. Personal pronouns are vague between masses, sets, and individuals.
<p>However, when the number expressed before “-mei” is an objective indefinite number of the kind explained in <a href="../8/">Section 8</a>, a slightly different place structure is required:</p>
<pre>
       x1 is a mass formed from a set x2 of n members, one or more of which is/are x3,
            measured relative to the set x4.
</pre>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">11.3)</a>  lei ratcu poi zvati le panka cu so'umei fo lo'i ratcu
       The-mass-of rats which are-in the park are a-fewsome with-respect-to the-set-of rats.
       The rats in the park are a small number of all the rats there are.
</pre>
In <a href="../11/#e3">Example 11.3</a>, the x2 and x3 places are vacant, and the x4 place is filled by “lo'i ratcu”, which (because no quantifiers are explicitly given) means “the whole of the set of all those things which are rats”, or simply “the set of all rats.”
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">11.4)</a>  le'i ratcu poi zvati le panka cu se so'imei
       The-set-of rats which-are in the park is-a manysome.
       There are many rats in the park.
</pre>
In <a href="../11/#e4">Example 11.4</a>, the conversion cmavo “se” swaps the x1 and the x2 places, so that the new x1 is the set. The x4 set is unspecified, so the implication is that the rats are “many” with respect to some unspecified comparison set.
<p>More explanations about the interrelationship of sets, masses, and individuals can be found in <a href="../../6/1/">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The cmavo “moi” creates ordinal selbri. The place structure is:</p>
<pre>
       x1 is the (n)th member of set x2 when ordered by rule x3
</pre>
Some examples:
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">11.5)</a>  ti pamoi le'i mi ratcu
       This-one is the first-of the rats associated-with me.
       This is my first rat.

<a id="e6" name="e6">11.6)</a>  ta romoi le'i mi ratcu
       That is-the-allth-of the rats associated-with me.
       That is my last rat.

<a id="e7" name="e7">11.7)</a>  mi raumoi le velskina porsi
       I am-enough-th-in the movie-audience sequence
       I am enough-th in the movie line.
</pre>
<a href="../11/#e7">Example 11.7</a> means, in the appropriate context, that my position in line is sufficiently far to the front that I will get a seat for the movie.
<p>The cmavo “si'e” creates portion selbri. The place structure is:</p>
<pre>
       x1 is an (n)th portion of mass x2
</pre>
Some examples:
<pre>
<a id="e8" name="e8">11.8)</a>  levi sanmi cu fi'ucisi'e lei mi djedi cidja
       This-here meal is-a-slash-three-portion-of my day-food.
       This meal is one-third of my daily food.
</pre>
<p>The cmavo “cu'o” creates probability selbri. The place structure is:</p>
<pre>
       event x1 has probability (n) of occurring under conditions x2
</pre>
The number must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. For example:
<pre>
<a id="e9" name="e9">11.9)</a>  le nu lo sicni cu sedja'o cu pimucu'o
       The event of a coin being a head-displayer has probability .5.
</pre>
<p>The cmavo “va'e” creates a scale selbri. The place structure is:</p>
<pre>
       x1 is at scale position (n) on the scale x2
</pre>
If the scale is granular rather than continuous, a form like “cifi'uxa” (3/6) may be used; in this case, 3/6 is not the same as 1/2, because the third position on a scale of six positions is not the same as the first position on a scale of two positions. Here is an example:
<pre>
<a id="e10" name="e10">11.10)</a> le vi rozgu cu sofi'upanova'e xunre
       This rose is 9/10-scale red.
       This rose is 9 out of 10 on the scale of redness.
       This rose is very red.
</pre>
<p>When the quantifier preceding any MOI cmavo includes the subjective numbers “rau”, “du'e”, or “mo'a” (enough, too many, too few) then an additional place is added for “by standard”. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11" name="e11">11.11)</a> lei ratcu poi zvati le panka cu du'emei fo mi
       The-mass-of rats which-are in the park are too-many by-standard me.
       There are too many rats in the park for me.
</pre>
The extra place (which for “-mei” is the x4 place labeled by “fo”) is provided rather than using a BAI tag such as “ma'i” because a specification of the standard for judgment is essential to the meaning of subjective words like “enough”.
<p>This place is not normally explicit when using one of the subjective numbers directly as a number. Therefore, “du'e ratcu” means “too many rats” without specifying any standard.</p>
<p>It is also grammatical to substitute a lerfu string for a number:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12" name="e12">11.12)</a> ta ny.moi le'i mi ratcu
       That is-nth-of the-set-of my rats.
       That is my nth rat.
</pre>
<p>More complex mekso cannot be placed directly in front of MOI, due to the resulting grammatical ambiguities. Instead, a somewhat artificial form of expression is required.</p>
<p>The cmavo “me” (of selma'o ME) has the function of making a sumti into a selbri. A whole “me” construction can have a member of MOI added to the end to create a complex mekso selbri:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13" name="e13">11.13)</a> ta me li ny. su'i pa me'u moi le'i mi ratcu
       That is the-number n plus one-th-of the-set-of my rats.
       That is my (n+1)-th rat.
</pre>
Here the mekso “ny. su'i pa” is made into a sumti (with “li”) and then changed into a mekso selbri with “me” and “me'u moi”. The elidable terminator “me'u” is required here in order to keep the “pa” and the “moi” separate; otherwise, the parser will combine them into the compound “pamoi” and reject the sentence as ungrammatical.
<p>It is perfectly possible to use non-numerical sumti after “me” and before a member of MOI, producing strange results indeed:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e14" name="e14">11.14)</a> le nu mi nolraitru
            cu me le'e snime bolci be vi la xel. cu'o
       The event-of me being-a-nobly-superlative-ruler
            has-the-stereotypical snow type-of-ball at Hell probability.
       I have a snowball’s chance in Hell of being king.
</pre>
Note: the elidable terminator “boi” is not used between a number and a member of MOI. As a result, the “me'u” in <a href="../11/#e13">Example 11.13</a> could also be replaced by a “boi”, which would serve the same function of preventing the “pa” and “moi” from joining into a compound.
