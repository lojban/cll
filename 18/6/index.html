          <h3><a id="6" name="6">6. Forethought operators (Polish notation, functions)</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   boi BOI numeral/lerfu string terminator
    va'a    VUhU    negation/additive inverse
    pe'o    PEhO    forethought flag
    ku'e    KUhE    forethought terminator
    py. BY  letter ``p''
    xy. BY  letter ``x''
    zy. BY  letter ``z''
    ma'o    MAhO    convert operand to operator
    fy. BY  letter ``f''
</pre>
    The infix form explained so far is reasonable for many
    purposes, but it is limited and rigid. It works smoothly only
    where all operators have exactly two operands, and where
    precedences can either be assumed from context or are limited
    to just two levels, with some help from parentheses. 

    <p>But there are many operators which do not have two operands,
    or which have a variable number of operands. The preferred form
    of expression in such cases is the use of ``forethought
    operators'', also known as Polish notation. In this style of
    writing mathematics, the operator comes first and the operands
    afterwards:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6-1"
name="6-1">6.1)</a>  li su'i paboi reboi ci[boi] du li xa
    the-number the-sum-of one two three equals the-number six
    sum(1,2,3) = 6
</pre>
    Note that the normally elidable number terminator ``boi'' is
    required after ``pa'' and ``re'' because otherwise the reading
    would be ``pareci'' = 123. It is not required after ``ci'' but
    is inserted here in brackets for the sake of symmetry. The only
    time ``boi'' is required is, as in <a href="../6/#1">Example
    6.1</a>, when there are two consecutive numbers or lerfu
    strings. 

    <p>Forethought mekso can use any number of operands, in <a
    href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a> three. How do we know how many
    operands there are in ambiguous circumstances? The usual Lojban
    solution is employed: an elidable terminator, namely ``ku'e''.
    Here is an example:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6-2"
name="6-2">6.2)</a>  li py. su'i va'a ny. ku'e su'i zy du li xy.
    the-number ``p'' plus negative-of( ``n'' ) plus ``z''
        equals the-number ``x''
    p + -n + z = x
</pre>
    where we know that ``va'a'' is a forethought operator because
    there is no operand preceding it. 

    <p>``va'a'' is the numerical negation operator, of selma'o
    VUhU. In contrast, j ``vu'u'' is not used for numerical
    negation, but only for subtraction, as it always has two or
    more operands. Do not confuse ``va'a'' and ``vu'u'', which are
    operators, with ``ni'u'', which is part of a number.</p>

    <p> In <a href="../6/#2">Example 6.2</a>, the operator ``va'a'' and
    the terminator ``ku'e'' serve in effect as parentheses. (The regular
    parentheses ``vei'' and ``ve'o'' are NOT used for this purpose.) If
    the ``ku'e'' were omitted, the ``su'i zy'' would be swallowed up by
    the ``va'a'' forethought operator, which would then appear to have
    two operands, ``ny'' and ``su'i zy.'', where the latter is also a
    forethought expression.</p>

    <p>Forethought mekso is also useful for matching standard
    functional notation. How do we represent ``z = f(x)''? The
    answer is:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>  li zy du li ma'o fy.boi xy.
    the-number z equals the-number the-operator f x
    z = f(x)
</pre>
    Again, no parentheses are used. The construct ``ma'o fy.boi''
    is the equivalent of an operator, and appears in forethought
    here (although it could also be used as a regular infix
    operator). In mathematics, letters sometimes mean functions and
    sometimes mean variables, with only the context to tell which.
    Lojban chooses to accept the variable interpretation as the
    default, and uses the special flag ``ma'o'' to mark a lerfu
    string as an operator. The cmavo ``xy.'' and ``zy.'' are
    variables, but ``fy.'' is an operator (a function) because
    ``ma'o'' marks it as such. The ``boi'' is required because
    otherwise the ``xy.'' would look like part of the operator
    name. (The use of ``ma'o'' can be generalized from lerfu
    strings to any mekso operand: see <a href=../21/>Section
    21</a>.) 

    <p>When using forethought mekso, the optional marker ``pe'o''
    may be placed in front of the operator. This usage can help
    avoid confusion by providing clearly marked ``pe'o'' and
    ``ku'e'' pairs to delimit the operand list. <a
    href="../6/#1">Examples 6.1</a> to <a href="../6/#3">6.3</a>,
    respectively, with explicit ``pe'o'' and ``ku'e'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="6-4"
name="6-4">6.4)</a>  li pe'o su'i paboi reboi ciboi ku'e du li xa
<a id="6-5"
name="6-5">6.5)</a>   li py. su'i pe'o va'a ny. ku'e su'i zy du li xy.
<a id="6-6"
name="6-6">6.6)</a>   li zy du li pe'o ma'o fy.boi xy. ku'e
</pre>
    Note: When using forethought mekso, be sure that the operands
    really are operands: they cannot contain regular infix
    expressions unless parenthesized with ``vei'' and ``ve'o''. An
    earlier version of the complex <a href="../17/#6">Example
    17.6</a> came to grief because I forgot this rule.
