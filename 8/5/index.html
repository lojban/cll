<h3>5. Non-veridical relative clauses: “voi”</h3>
<pre>
     voi     NOI                 non-veridical relative clause introducer
</pre>
<p>There is another member of selma'o NOI which serves to introduce a third kind of relative clause: “voi”. Relative clauses introduced by “voi” are restrictive, like those introduced by “poi”. However, there is a fundamental difference between “poi” and “voi” relative clauses. A “poi” relative clause is said to be veridical, in the same sense that a description using “lo” or “loi” is: it is essential to the interpretation that the bridi actually be true. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">5.1)</a>   le gerku poi blabi cu klama
       The dog which is-white goes.
</pre>
it must actually be true that the dog is white, or the sentence constitutes a miscommunication. If there is a white dog and a brown dog, and the speaker uses “le gerku poi blabi” to refer to the brown dog, then the listener will not understand correctly. However,
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">5.2)</a>   le gerku voi blabi cu klama
       The dog which-I-describe-as white goes.
</pre>
puts the listener on notice that the dog in question may not actually meet objective standards (whatever they are) for being white: only the speaker can say exactly what is meant by the term. In this way, “voi” is like “le”; the speaker’s intention determines the meaning.
<p>As a result, the following two sentences</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">5.3)</a>   le nanmu cu ninmu
       That-which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
       The “guy” is actually a gal.

<a id="e4" name="e4">5.4)</a>   ti voi nanmu cu ninmu
       This-thing which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
</pre>
mean essentially the same thing (except that <a href="../5/#e4">Example 5.4</a> involves pointing thanks to the use of “ti”, whereas <a href="../5/#e3">Example 5.3</a> doesn’t), and neither one is self-contradictory: it is perfectly all right to describe something as a man (although perhaps confusing to the listener) even if it actually is a woman.
