          <h3>7. Attitudinal modifiers</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ga'i    hauteur/rank    equal rank  meekness/lack of rank
            [galtu]
    le'o    aggressive  passive     defensive
    vu'e    virtue (zabna)          sin (mabla)
            [vrude]
    se'i    self-orientation        other-orientation
            [sevzi]
    ri'e    release     restraint   control
            [zifre]
    fu'i    with help      without help with opposition
        easily              with difficulty
            [frili]
    be'u     lack/need  presence/satisfaction   satiation
    se'a     self-sufficiency           dependency
            [sevzi]
</pre>
    It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion
    categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among
    emotions. These tended to fit nicely on scales of their own,
    but generally tend not to be thought of as separate emotions.
    Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in
    context. Some of these tend to go well with only a few of the
    attitudinals, others go with nearly all of them. To really
    understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with
    one or two of the attitudinals found in <a href=../2/>Sections
    2</a> and <a href=../3/>3</a>, and see what emotional pictures
    you can build: 

    <p>The cmavo “ga'i” expresses the scale used to indicate
    condescension or polite deference; it is not respect in
    general, which is “.io”. Whatever it is attached to is marked
    as being below (for “ga'i”) or above (for “ga'inai”) the
    speaker's rank or social position. Note that it is always the
    referent, not the speaker or listener, who is so marked: in
    order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the
    sentence, as with “doi ga'inai”, which can be appended to a
    statement addressed to a social inferior.</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  ko ga'inai
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [low-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    I would be honored if you would enter my residence.
</pre>
    Note that imperatives in Lojban need not be imperious!
    Corresponding examples with “ga'icu'i” and “ga'inai”: 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">7.2)</a>  ko ga'icu'i
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [equal-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    Come on in to my place.

<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>   ko ga'i
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [high-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    You! Get inside!
</pre>

    <p>Since “ga'i” expresses the relative rank of the speaker
    and the referent, it does not make much sense to attach it to
    “mi”, unless the speaker is using “mi” to refer to a group
    (as in English “we”), or a past or future version of himself
    with a different rank.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to attach “ga'i” to a whole bridi, in
    which case it expresses the speaker's superiority to the event
    the bridi refers to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">7.4)</a>  ga'i le xarju pu citka
    [high-rank!] the pig [past] eats
    The pig ate (which is an event beneath my notice).
</pre>
    When used without being attached to any bridi, “ga'i”
    expresses the speaker's superiority to things in general, which
    may represent an absolute social rank: “ga'icai” is an
    appropriate opening word for an emperor's address from the
    throne. 

    <p>The cmavo “le'o” represents the scale of aggressiveness.
    We seldom overtly recognize that we are feeling aggressive or
    defensive, but perhaps in counseling sessions, a psychologist
    might encourage someone to express these feelings on this
    scale. And football teams could be urged on by their coach
    using “ro'ole'o”. “le'o” is also useful in threats as an
    alternative to “o'onai”, which expresses anger.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “vu'e” represents ethical virtue or its absence.
    An excess of almost any emotion is usually somewhat “sinful”
    in the eyes of most ethical systems. On the other hand, we
    often feel virtuous about our feelings --- what we call
    righteous indignation might be “o'onaivu'e”. Note that this
    is distinct from lack of guilt: “.u'unai”.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “se'i” expresses the difference between selfish
    and generous, for example (in combination with “.au”):</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">7.5)</a>  ause'i
    [desire] [self]
    I want it!

<a id="6" name="6">7.6)</a>   ause'inai
    [desire] [other]
    I want you to have it!
</pre>

    <p>In both cases, the English “it” is vague, reflecting the
    absence of a bridi. <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a> and <a
    href="../7/#6">Example 7.6</a> are pure expressions of attitude.
    Analogously, “.uuse'i” is self-pity, whereas “.uuse'inai”
    is pity for someone else.</p>

    <p>The modifier “ri'e” indicates emotional release versus
    emotional control. “I will not let him know how angry I am”,
    you say to yourself before entering the room. The Lojban is
    much shorter:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">7.7)</a>  .o'onai ri'enai
    [anger] [control]
</pre>

    <p>On the other hand, “ri'e” can be used by itself to signal
    an emotional outburst.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “fu'i” may express a reason for feeling the way
    we do, as opposed to a feeling in itself; but it is a reason
    that is more emotionally determined than most. For example, it
    could show the difference between the mental discomfort
    mentioned in <a href=../6/>Section 6</a> when it is felt on an
    easy test, as opposed to on a hard test. When someone gives you
    a back massage, you could use “.o'ufu'i” to show appreciation
    for the assistance in your comfort.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “be'u” expresses, roughly speaking, whether the
    emotion it modifies is in response to something you don't have
    enough of, something you have enough of, or something you have
    too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of
    the subjective quantifier cmavo “mo'a”, “rau”, and “du'e”
    (these belong to selma'o PA, and are discussed in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>). For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">7.8)</a>  .uiro'obe'unai
    [Yay!] [physical] [Enough!]
</pre>
    might be something you say after a large meal which you
    enjoyed. 

    <p>Like all modifiers, “be'u” can be used alone:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">7.9)</a>  le cukta be'u cu zvati ma
    The book [Needed!] is at-location [what sumti?]
    Where's the book? --- I need it!
</pre>
    Lastly, the modifier “se'a” shows whether the feeling is
    associated with self-sufficiency or with dependence on others. 
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">7.10)</a>    .e'ese'a
    [I can!] [self-sufficient!]
    I can do it all by myself!
</pre>
    is something a Lojban-speaking child might say. On the other
    hand, 
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">7.11)</a>    .e'ese'anai
    [I can!] [dependent]
    I can do it if you help me.
</pre>
    from the same child would indicate a (hopefully temporary) loss
    of self- confidence. It is also possible to negate the “.e'e”
    in <a href="../7/#7">Example 7.7</a> and <a href="../7/#8">Example
    7.8</a>, leading to: 
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">7.12)</a>    .e'enaise'a
    [I can't] [self-sufficient]
    I can't do it by myself!
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">7.13)</a>    .e'enaise'anai
    [I can't!] [dependent]
    I can't do it if you insist on “helping” me!
</pre>
    Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to
    use. They might be for most circumstances. It is likely that
    most combinations will never get used. But if one person uses
    one of these expressions, another person can understand (as
    unambiguously as the expresser intends) what emotion is being
    expressed. Most probably as the system becomes well-known and
    internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal
    combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not
    cliches) of emotion.
