          <h3>10. Attitude questions; empathy; attitude contours</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     pei           attitude question
     dai           empathy
     bu'o          start emotion       continue emotion    end emotion
</pre>

    <p>You can ask someone how they are feeling with a normal bridi
    sentence, but you will get a normal bridi answer in response,
    one which may be true or false. Since the response to a
    question about emotions is no more logical than the emotion
    itself, this isn’t appropriate.</p>

    <p>The word “pei” is therefore reserved for attitude
    questions. Asked by itself, it captures all of the denotation
    of English “How are you?” coupled with “How do you feel?”
    (which has a slightly different range of usage).</p>

    <p>When asked in the context of discourse, “pei” acts like
    other Lojban question words --- it requests the respondent to
    “fill in the blank”, in this case with an appropriate
    attitudinal describing the respondent’s feeling about the
    referent expression. As with other questions, plausibility is
    polite; if you answer with an irrelevant UI cmavo, such as a
    discursive, you are probably making fun of the questioner. (A
    “ge'e”, however, is always in order --- you are not required
    to answer emotionally. This is not the same as “.i'inai”,
    which is privacy as the reverse of conviviality.)</p>

    <p>Most often, however, the asker will use “pei” as a place
    holder for an intensity marker. (As a result, “pei” is placed
    in selma'o CAI, although selma'o UI would have been almost as
    appropriate. Grammatically, there is no difference between UI
    and CAI.) Such usage corresponds to a whole range of idiomatic
    usages in natural languages:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">10.1)</a>    .iepei
    [agreement] [question]
    Do you agree?

<a id="2" name="2">10.2)</a> .iare'epei
    [belief] [spiritual] [question]
    Are you a Believer?

<a id="3" name="3">10.3)</a> .aipei
    [intention] [question]
    Are you going to do it?
</pre>
    <a href="../10/#3">Example 10.3</a> might appear at the end of a
    command, to which the response 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">10.4)</a>    .aicai
    [intention] [maximal]
</pre>
    corresponds to “Aye! Aye!” (hence the choice of cmavo). 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">10.5)</a>    .e'apei
    [permission] [question]
    Please, Mommy!  Can I??
</pre>
    Additionally, when “pei” is used at the beginning of an
    indicator construct, it asks specifically if that construct
    reflects the attitude of the respondent, as in (asked of
    someone who has been ill or in pain): 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">10.6)</a>    pei.o'u
    [question] [comfort]
    Are you comfortable?

<a id="7" name="7">10.7)</a> pei.o'ucu'i
    [question] [comfort] [neutral]
    Are you no longer in pain?

<a id="8" name="8">10.8)</a> pei.o'usai
    [question] [comfort] [strong]
    Are you again healthy?
</pre>
    Empathy, which is not really an emotion, is expressed by the
    indicator “dai”. (Don’t confuse empathy with sympathy, which
    is “.uuse'inai”.) Sometimes, as when telling a story, you
    want to attribute emotion to someone else. You can of course
    make a bridi claim that so-and-so felt such-and-such an
    emotion, but you can also make use of the attitudinal system by
    adding the indicator “dai”, which attributes the preceding
    attitudinal to someone else --- exactly whom, must be
    determined from context. You can also use “dai”
    conversationally when you empathize, or feel someone else’s
    emotion as if it were your own: 
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">10.9)</a>    .oiro'odai
    [pain!] [physical] [empathy]
    Ouch, that must have hurt!
</pre>

    <p>It is even possible to “empathize” with a non-living
    object:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">10.10)</a>  le bloti .iidai .uu pu
        klama le xasloi
    the ship [fear!] [empathy] [pity!] [past]
        goes-to the ocean-floor
    Fearfully the ship, poor thing, sank.
</pre>
    suggesting that the ship felt fear at its impending
    destruction, and simultaneously reporting the speaker’s pity
    for it. 

    <p>Both “pei” and “dai” represent exceptions to the normal
    rule that attitudinals reflect the speaker’s attitude.</p>

    <p>Finally, we often want to report how our attitudes are
    changing. If our attitude has not changed, we can just repeat
    the attitudinal. (Therefore, “.ui .ui .ui” is not the same as
    “.uicai”, but simply means that we are continuing to be
    happy.) If we want to report that we are beginning to feel,
    continuing to feel, or ceasing to feel an emotion, we can use
    the attitudinal contour cmavo “bu'o”.</p>

    <p>When attached to an attitudinal, “bu'o” means that you are
    starting to have that attitude, “bu'ocu'i” that you are
    continuing to have it, and “bu'onai” that you are ceasing to
    have it. Some examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">10.11)</a>  o'onai bu'o
    [anger!] [start emotion]
    I’m getting angry!

<a id="12" name="12">10.12)</a>   .iu bu'onai .uinai
    [love!] [end emotion] [unhappiness!]
    I don’t love you any more; I’m sad.
</pre>

    <p>Note the difference in effect between <a
    href="../10/#12">Example 10.12</a> and:</p>
<pre>
<a id="10-13"
name="10-13">10.13)</a>  mi ca ba'o prami do ja'e le nu
        mi badri
    I [present] [cessitive] love you with-result the event-of
        (I am-sad).
    I no longer love you; therefore, I am sad.
</pre>
    which is a straightforward bridi claim. <a
    href="../10/#13">Example 10.13</a> states that you have (or have
    had) certain emotions; <a href="../10/#12">Example 10.12</a>
    expresses those emotions directly.
