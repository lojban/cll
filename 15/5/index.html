          <h3>5. Expressing scales in selbri negation</h3>

    <p>In expressing a scalar negation, we must provide some
    indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe
    of discourse that is being dealt with in an assertion. As
    stated in <a href=../4/>Section 4</a>, the default is the set
    of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
    The chair is a non-(red-thing).
</pre>
    the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color
    and not 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>  le stizu cu dzukla be le zarci
    The chair walkingly-goes-to-the-market.
</pre>

    <p>However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or
    contrary listener, or simply an overt logical analysis), we can
    clarify that we are referring to a color by saying:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre skari
    The chair is of a non-(red)-color
        (as perceived by something under some conditions).
</pre>

    <p>We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making
    the two trailing sumti values explicit (the “as perceived by”
    and “under conditions” places have been added to the place
    structure of “xunre”). But assume we have a really stubborn
    listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will
    find a way to misinterpret <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> even
    with three specific sumti provided.</p>

    <p>In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita
    “ci'u”, which translates roughly as “on a scale of X”,
    where “X” is the sumti. For maximal clarity, the tagged sumti
    can be bound into the negated selbri with “be”. To clarify <a
    href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a>, we might say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-4"
name="5-4">5.4)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a non-(red on-a-scale-of-colorness)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>We can alternately use the sumti tcita “teci'e”, based on
    “ciste”, which translates roughly as “of a system of
    components X”, for universes of discourse; in this case, we
    would express <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be teci'e le skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-with-components-the-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>Other places of “ciste” can be brought out using the
    grammar of selma'o BAI modals, allowing slightly different
    forms of expression, thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">5.6)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be ci'e lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo “le'a”, also in selma'o BAI, can be used to
    specify a category:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">5.7)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be le'a lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-category-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>
    which is minimally different in meaning from <a
    href="../5/#6">Example 5.6</a>. 

    <p>The cmavo “na'e” is not the only member of selma'o NAhE.
    If we want to express a scalar negation which is a polar
    opposite, we use the cmavo “to'e”, which is grammatically
    equivalent to “na'e”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">5.8)</a>  le stizu cu to'e xunre
        be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a (opposite-of red)
        on-scale a-property-of color-ness.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the
    cmavo “no'e”, also grammatically equivalent to “na'e”. Here
    are some parallel examples of “na'e”, “no'e”, and
    “to'e”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">5.9)</a>  ta melbi
    That is-beautiful.

<a id="10" name="10">5.10)</a> ta na'e melbi
    That is-non-beautiful.
    That is other than beautiful.
    That is ugly [in one sense].

<a id="11" name="11">5.11)</a> ta no'e melbi
    That is-neutrally beautiful.
    That is plain/ordinary-looking
        (neither ugly nor beautiful).

<a id="12" name="12">5.12)</a> ta to'e melbi
    That is-opposite-of beautiful.
    That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo “to'e” has the assigned rafsi “-tol-” and
    “-to'e-”; the cmavo “no'e” has the assigned rafsi “-nor-”
    and “-no'e-”. The selbri in <a href="../5/#10">Example 5.10</a>
    through <a href="../5/#12">Example 5.12</a> could be replaced by
    the lujvo “nalmle”, “normle”, and “tolmle”
    respectively.</p>

    <p>This large variety of scalar negations is provided because
    different scales have different properties. Some scales are
    open-ended in both directions: there is no “ultimately ugly”
    or “ultimately beautiful”. Other scales, like temperature,
    are open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum
    temperature (so-called “absolute zero”) but no maximum
    temperature. Still other scales are closed at both ends.</p>

    <p>Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious “to'e” &mdash;
    what is the opposite of a dog? &mdash; while others have more than
    one, and need “ci'u” to specify which opposite is meant.</p>
