          <h3>4. selbri and tanru negation</h3>

    <p>All the scalar negations illustrated in <a
    href=../3/>Section 3</a> are expressed in Lojban using the
    cmavo “na’e” (of selma’o NAhE). The most common use of
    “na’e” is as a prefix to the selbri:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go to the market.

<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>   mi na’e klama le zarci
    I non-go to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Comparing these two, we see that the negation operator being
    used in <a href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a> is “na’e”. But what
    exactly does “na’e” negate? Does the negation include only
    the gismu “klama”, which is the entire selbri in this case,
    or does it include the “le zarci” as well? In Lojban, the
    answer is unambiguously “only the gismu”. The cmavo “na’e”
    always applies only to what follows it.</p>

    <p><a href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a> looks as if it were parallel
    to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>  mi na klama le zarci
    I [false] go-to the market.
</pre>
    but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation
    using “na” denies the truth of a relationship, but a selbri
    negation with “na’e” asserts that a relationship exists other
    than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti
    identified in the statement. The grammar allotted to “na’e”
    allows us to unambiguously express scalar negations in terms of
    scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the
    scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of “na’e” is
    determined. 

    <p>In tanru, we may wish to negate an individual element before
    combining it with another to form the tanru. We in effect need
    a shorter-than-selbri-scope negation, for which we can use
    “na’e” as well. The positive sentence</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  mi cadzu klama le zarci
    I walking-ly go to the market.
</pre>
    can be subjected to selbri negation in several ways. Two are: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">4.5)</a>  mi na’e cadzu klama le zarci
    I (other-than-walkingly)-go-to the market.

<a id="6" name="6">4.6)</a>   mi cadzu na’e klama le zarci
    I walkingly-(other-than-go-to) the market.
</pre>

    <p>These negations show the default scope of “na’e” is
    close-binding on an individual brivla in a tanru. <a
    href="../4/#5">Example 4.5</a> says that I am going to the
    market, but in some kind of a non-walking manner. (As with most
    tanru, there are a few other possible interpretations, but
    we’ll assume this one --- see <a href="../../5/1/">Chapter
    5</a> for a discussion of tanru meaning).</p>

    <p>In neither <a href="../4/#5">Example 4.5</a> nor <a
    href="../4/#6">Example 4.6</a> does the “na’e” negate the
    entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations that deny
    a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a
    component which makes a positive claim about such a
    relationship. This is clearer in <a href="../4/#5">Example
    4.5</a>, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking
    manner. In <a href="../4/#6">Example 4.6</a>, we have claimed
    that the relationship between me and the market in some way
    involves walking, but is not one of “going to” (perhaps we
    are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the
    market).</p>

    <p>The “scale”, or actually the “set”, implied in Lojban
    tanru negations is anything which plausibly can be substituted
    into the tanru. (Plausibility here is interpreted in the same
    way that answers to a “mo” question must be plausible --- the
    result must not only have the right number of places and have
    sumti values appropriate to the place structure, it must also
    be appropriate or relevant to the context.) This minimal
    condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while
    still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who
    uses selbri negation is denying one relationship, while
    minimally asserting a different relationship.</p>

    <p>We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer
    than a single brivla. There exists such a longer-scope selbri
    negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban sentence in the
    next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the
    second copy showing the scope of the “na’e”):</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-7"
name="4-7">4.7)</a>  mi na’eke cadzu klama [ke’e] le zarci
    mi na’e (ke cadzu klama [ke’e]) le zarci
    I other-than-(walkingly-go-to) the market.
</pre>

    <p>This negation uses the same “ke” and “ke’e” delimiters
    (the “ke’e” is always elidable at the end of a selbri) that
    are used in tanru. The sentence clearly negates the entire
    selbri. The “ke’e”, whether elided or not, reminds us that
    the negation does not include the trailing sumti. While the
    trailing-sumti place-structure is defined as that of the final
    brivla, the trailing sumti themselves are not part of the
    selbri and are thus not negated by “na’e”.</p>

    <p>Negations of just part of the selbri are also permitted:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-8"
name="4-8">4.8)</a>  mi na’eke sutra cadzu ke’e klama le zarci
    mi na’e (ke sutra cadzu ke’e) klama le zarci
    I other-than-(quickly-walkingly) go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a>, only the “sutra cadzu”
    tanru is negated, so the speaker is indeed going to the market,
    but not by walking quickly.</p>

    <p>Negations made with “na’e” or “na’eke” also include
    within their scope any sumti attached to the brivla or tanru
    with “be” or “bei”. Such attached sumti are considered part
    of the brivla or tanru:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-9"
name="4-9">4.9)</a>  mi na’e ke sutra cadzu be le mi birka ke’e
        klama le zarci
    I other-than-(quickly walking-on-my-arms-ly)
        go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Note that <a href="../4/#10">Example 4.10</a> and <a
    href="../4/#11">Example 4.11</a> do not express the same
    thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-10"
name="4-10">4.10)</a>    mi na’eke sutra cadzu [ke’e] lemi birka
    mi na’e (ke sutra cadzu [ke’e]) lemi birka
    I other-than-(quickly-walk-on) my-arms.

<a id="4-11"
name="4-11">4.11)</a> mi na’eke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke’e]
    mi na’e (ke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke’e])
    I other-than-(quickly-walk-on my-arms).
</pre>

    <p>The translations show that the negation in <a
    href="../4/#10">Example 4.10</a> is more restricted in scope;
    i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1
    (“mi”).</p>

    <p>Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban’s claims
    to be unambiguous, let us indicate the relative precedence of
    “na’e” as an operator. Grouping with “ke” and “ke’e”, of
    course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. “na’e” is
    very close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru,
    with “bo”, is not as tightly bound as “na’e”. “co”, the
    tanru inversion operator has a scope that is longer than all
    other tanru constructs.</p>

    <p>In short, “na’e” and “na’eke” define a type of negation,
    which is shorter in scope than bridi negation, and which
    affects all or part of a selbri. The result of “na’e”
    negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not
    merely a denial of another claim.</p>

    <p>The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the
    rafsi “-nal-”, representing “na’e” when a tanru is
    condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel to the English
    usage of “non-”. Turning a series of related negations into
    lujvo gives:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">4.12)</a>    na’e klama becomes nalkla
    na’e cadzu klama becomes naldzukla
    na’e sutra cadzu klama becomes nalsu’adzukla
    nake sutra cadzu ke’e klama becomes nalsu’adzuke’ekla
</pre>

    <p>Note: “-kem-” is the rafsi for “ke”, but it is omitted
    in the final lujvo as superfluous --- “ke’e” is its own
    rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a “ke” after
    the “-nal-”, since it needs to close something; only a “ke”
    immediately after the negation would make the “ke’e”
    meaningful in the tanru expressed in this lujvo.</p>

    <p>In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate “-nal-”
    as “non-”, to match the English combining forms, except when
    the “na’e” has single word scope and English uses “un-” or
    “im-” to negate that single word. Translation style should
    determine the use of “other than”, “non-”, or another
    negator for “na’e” in tanru; the translator must render the
    Lojban into English so it is clear in context. Let’s go back to
    our simplest example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">4.13)</a>    mi na’e klama le zarci
    I am other-than-(going-to) the market.
    ?I am not going-to the market.

<a id="14" name="14">4.14)</a> mi nalkla le zarci
    I am-a-non-go-er-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Note that to compare with the English translation form using
    “non-”, we’ve translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a
    noun. Since Lojban “klama” is indifferently a noun, verb, or
    adjective, the difference is purely a translation change, not a
    true change in meaning. The English difference seems
    significant, though, due to the strongly different English
    grammatical forms and the ambiguity of English negation.</p>

    <p>Consider the following highly problematic sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="15" name="15">4.15)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu’e
        cu krecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-hair-without.
    The current King of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>The selbri “krecau” negates with “na’e” as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="16" name="16">4.16)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu’e
        cu na’e krecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-other-than hair-without.
    The current King of France is other-than-bald.
</pre>
    or, as a lujvo: 
<pre>
<a id="17" name="17">4.17)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu’e
        cu nalkrecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-non-hair-without.
    The current King of France is a non-bald-one.
</pre>
    <a href="../4/#16">Example 4.16</a> and <a href="../4/#17">Example
    4.17</a> express the predicate negation forms using a negation
    word (“na’e”) or rafsi (“-nal-”); yet they make positive
    assertions about the current King of France; ie., that he is
    other-than-bald or non-bald. This follows from the close
    binding of “na’e” to the brivla. The lujvo form makes this
    overt by absorbing the negative marker into the word. 

    <p>Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say
    that he is bald, or non-bald, or to make any other affirmative
    claim about him. Any sentence about the current King of France
    containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence
    without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any
    effect on the truth value of the sentence, which is invariably
    “false”, since no affirmative statement about the current
    King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation
    does produce a truth:</p>
<pre>
<a id="18" name="18">4.18)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu’e
        cu na krecau
    An-actual current noblest-governor
        of the French Country
        [false] is-hair-without.
    It is false that the current King of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>Note: “lo” is used in these sentences because negation
    relates to truth conditions. To meaningfully talk about truth
    conditions in sentences carrying a description, it must be
    clear that the description actually applies to the referent. A
    sentence using “le” instead of “lo” can be true even if
    there is no current king of France, as long as the speaker and
    the listener agree to describe something as the current king of
    France. (See the explanations of “le” in <a
    href="../../6/1/">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
