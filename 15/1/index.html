      <h2>Chapter 15<br />
      “No” Problems: On Lojban Negation</h2>

          <h3>1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of
    Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation,
    simply put, is to come up with a complete definition of the
    word “not”. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar, this means
    further that meanings of “not” with different grammatical
    effect must be different words, and even different grammatical
    structures.</p>

    <p>Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical
    language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into
    Lojban's logical connectives and other structures.</p>

    <p>In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European
    grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are
    typically called “subject” and “predicate”. In the
    statement</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  John goes to the store
</pre>
    “John” is the subject, and “goes to the store” is the
    predicate. Negating <a href="../1/#1">Example 1.1</a> to produce 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">1.2)</a>  John doesn't go to the store.
</pre>
    has the effect of declaring that the predicate does not hold
    for the subject. <a href="../1/#2">Example 1.2</a> says nothing
    about whether John goes somewhere else, or whether someone else
    besides John goes to the store. 

    <p>We will call this kind of negation “natural language
    negation”. This kind of negation is difficult to manipulate by
    the tools of logic, because it doesn't always follow the rules
    of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is
    true, or it is false. If a statement is false, then its
    negation must be true. Such negation is termed contradictory
    negation.</p>

    <p>Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation
    can violate the rules of contradictory negation.</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">1.3)</a>  Some animals are not white.

<a id="4" name="4">1.4)</a>   Some animals are white.
</pre>

    <p>Both of these statements are true; yet one is apparently the
    negation of the other. Another example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">1.5)</a>  I mustn't go to the dance.

<a id="6" name="6">1.6)</a>   I must go to the dance.
</pre>

    <p>At first thought, <a href="../1/#5">Example 1.5</a> negates <a
    href="../1/#6">Example 1.6</a>. Thinking further, we realize that
    there is an intermediate state wherein I am permitted to go to
    the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible
    that both statements are false.</p>

    <p>Sometimes order is significant:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1-7"
name="1-7">1.7)</a>  The falling rock didn't kill Sam.

<a id="1-8"
name="1-8">1.8)</a>   Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.
</pre>

    <p>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because <a
    href="../1/#7">Example 1.7</a> is written in what is called the
    “active voice”, we immediately get confused about whether
    “the falling rock” is a suitable subject for the predicate
    “did kill Sam”. “Kill” implies volition to us, and rocks do
    not have volition. This confusion is employed by opponents of
    gun control who use the argument “Guns don't kill people;
    people kill people.”</p>

    <p>Somehow, we don't have the same problem with <a
    href="../1/#8">Example 1.8</a>. The subject is Sam, and we
    determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he
    was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.</p>

    <p><a href="../1/#8">Example 1.8</a> also helps us focus on the
    fact that there are at least two questionable facts implicit in
    this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and if so, whether the
    falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of
    what killed him is moot.</p>

    <p>This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject
    of the sentence turns out not to exist:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1-9"
name="1-9">1.9)</a>  The King of Mexico didn't come to dinner.

<a id="1-10"
name="1-10">1.10)</a> The King of Mexico did come to dinner.
</pre>

    <p>In the natural languages, we would be inclined to say that
    both of these statements are false, since there is no King of
    Mexico.</p>

    <p>The rest of this chapter is designed to explain the Lojban
    model of negation.</p>
