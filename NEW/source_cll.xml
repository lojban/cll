    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Logical Language Group</primary><secondary>relation to Lojban</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Lojban</primary><secondary>history of</secondary></indexterm> Lojban (pronounced 
    <quote>LOZH-bahn</quote>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called 
    <quote>Loglan</quote> by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article 
    
    
    <quote><citetitle pubwork="article">Loglan</citetitle></quote>, published in 
    <citetitle pubwork="journal">Scientific American</citetitle>, June, 1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel 
    
    <citetitle pubwork="book">The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</citetitle>) and computer publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Lojban</primary><secondary>features of</secondary></indexterm> There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways.

    <title>What is this book?</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>goal of this book</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>goal of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>reference grammar</primary></indexterm> This book is what is called a 
    <quote>reference grammar</quote>. It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present. Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features. The word 
    
    <quote>discover</quote> is used advisedly; Lojban was not 
    <quote>invented</quote> by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.</para>
    <para>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tour"/> gives a brief overview of the language, 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/> gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic flesh on those formal bones. I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become available.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>linguistic drift</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Lojban</primary><secondary>stability of</secondary></indexterm> Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary &ndash; Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world, as 
    <xref linkend="chapter-lujvo"/> explains &ndash; and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?) native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language-meisters.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>structure of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>structure of this book</primary></indexterm> It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas. Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>chapter titles</primary><secondary>intent of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>jokes</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Lojbanistan</primary></indexterm> Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of 
    <xref linkend="chapter-about"/> (which you are now reading), for example, is an allusion to the book 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">English As We Speak It In Ireland</citetitle>, by P. W. Joyce, which is a sort of informal reference grammar of Hiberno-English. 
    
    <quote>Lojbanistan</quote> is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language, and a term for the actual community of Lojban-speakers, scattered over the world. Why 
    
    <quote>mangle</quote>? As yet, nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all well, by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan; that is one of the circumstances this book is meant to help remedy.</para>
    
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-conventions">
    <title>What are the typographical conventions of this book?</title>
    
    <para>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>examples of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>examples in this book</primary></indexterm> The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-hrtj">
      <title>
        

<indexterm type="example"><primary>go to the store</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>


        <anchor xml:id="c1e3d1"/>
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>mi klama le zarci</jbo>
        <gloss>I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.</gloss>
        <natlang>I go to the store.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>  will become wearisomely familiar before 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/> is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>examples</primary><secondary>structure of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>structure of examples</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>example of examples</primary></indexterm> It is useful to talk further about 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-hrtj"/> for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the 
    
    <quote>literal translation</quote> and the 
    <quote>colloquial translation</quote> respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>square brackets</primary><secondary>use of in notation</secondary></indexterm> Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-phonology"/>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>grammatical categories</primary><secondary>use of upper case for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>tables</primary><secondary>format of</secondary></indexterm> Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>technical terms</primary></indexterm> A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-tour"/>, except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-disclaimers">
    <title>Disclaimers</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>disclaimers</primary></indexterm> It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>dictionary</primary><secondary>superior authority of</secondary></indexterm> When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published). If so, the information given in the dictionary supersedes whatever is given here.</para>

    <para>Nick Nicholas (NSN) would like to thank the following Lojbanists: Mark Shoulson, Veijo Vilva, Colin Fine, And Rosta, and Iain Alexander for their suggestions and comments; John Cowan, for his extensive comments, his exemplary trailblazing of Lojban grammar, and for solving the 
    <valsi>manskapi</valsi> dilemma for NSN; Jorge Llambias, for his even more extensive comments, and for forcing NSN to think more than he was inclined to; Bob LeChevalier, for his skeptical overview of the issue, his encouragement, and for scouring all Lojban text his computer has been burdened with for lujvo; Nora Tansky LeChevalier, for writing the program converting old rafsi text to new rafsi text, and sparing NSN from embarrassing errors; and Jim Carter, for his dogged persistence in analyzing lujvo algorithmically, which inspired this research, and for first identifying the three lujvo classes.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Brown</primary><secondary>James Cooke</secondary></indexterm> Of course, the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James Cooke Brown as the language inventor, and also to several earlier contributors to the development of the language. Especially noteworthy are Doug Landauer, Jeff Prothero, Scott Layson, Jeff Taylor, and Bob McIvor. Final responsibility for the remaining errors and infelicities is solely mine.</para>

  <section xml:id="section-bibliography">
    <title>Informal Bibliography</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Loglan</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>bibliography</primary></indexterm> The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is one of the products, is 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">Loglan 1: A Logical Language</citetitle> by James Cooke Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.). The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him.</para>
    
    <para>The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American philosopher W. v.O. Quine, especially 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">Word and Object</citetitle> (1960, M.I.T. Press). Much of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on observation sentences, reads like a literal translation from Lojban.</para>
    
    <para>The theory of negation expounded in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-negation"/> is derived from a reading of Laurence Horn's work 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">A Natural History of Negation</citetitle>.</para>
    <para>Of course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the uses or misuses I have made of their works.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>books about Lojban</primary></indexterm> Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three other books about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English dictionary, and a book containing general information about Lojban. You can probably get these books, if they have been published, from the same place where you got this book. In addition, other books not yet foreseen may also exist.</para>

    <title>The concept of the bridi</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>bridi</primary><secondary>concept of</secondary></indexterm> This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a 
    <quote>quick tour</quote> of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para> 


 Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:</para>

However, in English, we use the noun 
    
    <quote>father</quote> to describe a static relationship in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qIuj"/>, the verb 
    <quote>hits</quote> to describe an active relationship in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qiuQ"/>, and the adjective 
    <quote>taller</quote> to describe an attributive relationship in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qIuS"/>. In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a 
    <quote>predication</quote>; in Lojban it is called a 
    <valsi>bridi</valsi>, and the central part of speech is the 
    <valsi>selbri</valsi>. Logicians refer to the things thus related as 
    <quote>arguments</quote>, while Lojbanists call them 
    <valsi>sumti</valsi>. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.</para>

 In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English, for example, 
    <quote>give</quote> has three places: the donor, the recipient and the gift. For example:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-DE08">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c2e1d4"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>give</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>John gives Sam the book.</para>
    </example>
    <para>and</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-IBBE">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c2e1d5"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>give</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>Sam gives John the book.</para>
    </example>
    <para>mean two different things because the relative positions of 
    <quote>John</quote> and 
    <quote>Sam</quote> have been switched. Further,</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-DxbA">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c2e1d6"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>give</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>The book gives John Sam.</para>
    </example>
    <para>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by 
    <quote>give</quote> has not changed.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>place structure</primary><secondary>definition of</secondary></indexterm> In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known collectively as its 
    <quote>place structure</quote>. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a 
    <valsi>gismu</valsi>, and the definition in a dictionary gives the place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti places.</para>
    <para>This book uses the Lojban terms 
    <valsi>bridi</valsi>, 
    <valsi>sumti</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>selbri</valsi>, because it is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</para>

    <title>Pronunciation</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>pronunciation</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-phonology"/>, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>vowels</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> Lojban has six recognized vowels: 
    <letteral>a</letteral>, 
    <letteral>e</letteral>, 
    <letteral>i</letteral>, 
    <letteral>o</letteral>, 
    <letteral>u</letteral> and 
    <letteral>y</letteral>. The first five are roughly pronounced as 
    <quote>a</quote> as in 
    <quote>father</quote>, 
    <letteral>e</letteral> as in 
    <quote>let</quote>, 
    <letteral>i</letteral> as in 
    <quote>machine</quote>, 
    <letteral>o</letteral> as in 
    <quote>dome</quote> and 
    <letteral>u</letteral> as in 
    <quote>flute</quote>. 
    <letteral>y</letteral> is pronounced as the sound called 
    <quote>schwa</quote>, that is, as the unstressed 
    <quote>a</quote> as in 
    <quote>about</quote> or 
    <quote>around</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>consonants</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: 
    <letteral>b</letteral>, 
    <letteral>d</letteral>, 
    <letteral>f</letteral>, 
    <letteral>k</letteral>, 
    <letteral>l</letteral>, 
    <letteral>m</letteral>, 
    <letteral>n</letteral>, 
    <letteral>p</letteral>, 
    <letteral>r</letteral>, 
    <letteral>t</letteral>, 
    <letteral>v</letteral> and 
    <letteral>z</letteral>. The letter 
    <letteral>c</letteral>, on the other hand is pronounced as the 
    <quote>sh</quote> in 
    <quote>hush</quote>, while 
    <letteral>j</letteral> is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the 
    <quote>s</quote> in 
    <quote>pleasure</quote>. 
    <letteral>g</letteral> is always pronounced as it is in 
    <quote>gift</quote>, never as in 
    <quote>giant</quote>. 
    <letteral>s</letteral> is as in 
    <quote>sell</quote>, never as in 
    <quote>rose</quote>. The sound of 
    <letteral>x</letteral> is not found in English in normal words. It is found as 
    <quote xml:lang="sco">ch</quote> in Scottish 
    <quote xml:lang="sco">loch</quote>, as 
    <quote xml:lang="es">j</quote> in Spanish 
    <quote xml:lang="es">junta</quote>, and as 
    <quote xml:lang="de">ch</quote> in German 
    <quote xml:lang="de">Bach</quote>; it also appears in the English interjection 
    <quote>yecchh!</quote>. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter 
    <letteral>r</letteral> can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>diphthongs</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> The Lojban diphthongs 
    <diphthong>ai</diphthong>, 
    <diphthong>ei</diphthong>, 
    <diphthong>oi</diphthong>, and 
    <diphthong>au</diphthong> are pronounced much as in the English words 
    <quote>sigh</quote>, 
    <quote>say</quote>, 
    <quote>boy</quote>, and 
    <quote>how</quote>. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an 
    <letteral>i</letteral> pronounced like English 
    <quote>y</quote> (for example, 
    <diphthong>io</diphthong> is pronounced 
    <quote>yo</quote>) or else with a 
    <letteral>u</letteral> pronounced like English 
    <quote>w</quote> (for example, 
    <diphthong>ua</diphthong> is pronounced 
    <quote>wa</quote>).</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>period</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>apostrophe</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Lojban also has three 
    <quote>semi-letters</quote>: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter 
    
    <quote>h</quote>. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>stress</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is 
    <letteral>y</letteral>, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</para>
    <para>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.</para>

    <para>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which has become first in the sentence. This kind of sentence is termed an observative, because it is often used when someone first observes or takes note of the relationship, and wishes to quickly communicate it to someone else. Commonly understood English observatives include 
    
    
    <quote>Smoke!</quote> upon seeing smoke or smelling the odor, or 
    <quote>Car!</quote> to a person crossing the street who might be in danger. Any Lojban selbri can be used as an observative if no sumti appear before the selbri.</para>
    
    <para>The word 
    <valsi>cu</valsi> does not occur in an observative; 
    
    <valsi>cu</valsi> is a separator, and there must be a sumti before the selbri that needs to be kept separate for 
    <valsi>cu</valsi> to be used. With no sumti preceding the selbri, 
    <valsi>cu</valsi> is not permitted. Short words like 
    <valsi>cu</valsi> which serve grammatical functions are called 
    <valsi>cmavo</valsi> in Lojban.</para>

    <para> The cmavo 
    <valsi>ve</valsi> and

    <valsi>te</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ve</valsi>, and

    <para>More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>passive voice</primary></indexterm> The effect is similar to what in English is called the 
    <quote>passive voice</quote>. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as 
    
    
    <jbophrase>le selbri [ku]</jbophrase> (see 
    <xref linkend="section-description-sumti"/>).</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-structure-of-utterances">
    <title>The basic structure of longer utterances</title>
    <para> People don't always say just one sentence. Lojban has a specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> and 
    <valsi>i</valsi>. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.</para>
    
    <para>The cmavo 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> separates paragraphs (covering different topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> s, with perhaps 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'oni'o</jbophrase> used to indicate a chapter, 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'o</jbophrase> to indicate a section, and a single 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <valsi>i</valsi> separates sentences. It is sometimes compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The cmavo 
    <valsi>xu</valsi>, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-basic-questions"/>, is one such word &ndash; it turns the sentence from a statement to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will usually omit the 
    <valsi>i</valsi> even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.</para>
    <para>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the 
    <valsi>i</valsi> before continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good translation for

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>possession not ownership</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> In Lojban, possession doesn't necessarily mean ownership: one may 
    <quote>possess</quote> a chair simply by sitting on it, even though it actually belongs to someone else. English uses possession casually in the same way, but also uses it to refer to actual ownership or even more intimate relationships: 
    <quote>my arm</quote> doesn't mean 
    <quote>some arm I own</quote> but rather 
    <quote>the arm that is part of my body</quote>. Lojban has methods of specifying all these different kinds of possession precisely and easily.</para>

Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left.

    <quote>but</quote> and

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-1Acu"/>, and of many other possible English sentences as well. It is not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-xIVa"/> would be:</para>

    <para>necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag 
    <valsi>ca</valsi>. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the 
    <valsi>cu</valsi>, and they may make a 
    <valsi>cu</valsi> unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>space tenses</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Lojban also extends the notion of 
    <quote>tense</quote> to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag 
    <valsi>vu</valsi> to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:</para>

As a consequence, the standard Lojban orthography must assign to each distinct sound, or phoneme, a unique letter or symbol. Each letter or symbol has only one sound or, more accurately, a limited range of sounds that are permitted pronunciations for that phoneme. Some symbols indicate stress (speech emphasis) and pause, which are also essential to Lojban word recognition. In addition, everything that is represented in other languages by punctuation (when written) or by tone of voice (when spoken) is represented in Lojban by words. These two properties together are known technically as <quote>audio-visual isomorphism</quote>.</para>

Thus the English name 
    <quote>Josephine</quote>, as normally pronounced, is Lojbanized as 
    <cmevla>DJOsefin.</cmevla>, pronounced 
    <phrase role="IPA">['dʒosɛfinʔ]</phrase>. (See 
    <xref linkend="section-basic-phonetics"/> for an explanation of the symbols within square brackets.) Technically, it is sufficient to capitalize the vowel letter, in this case 
    
    <letteral>O</letteral>, but it is easier on the reader to capitalize the whole syllable.</para>
    <para>Without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban stress would cause the 
    
    <valsi>se</valsi> syllable to be stressed. Lojbanized names are meant to represent the pronunciation of names from other languages with as little distortion as may be; as such, they are exempt from many of the regular rules of Lojban phonology, as will appear in the rest of this chapter.</para>

    <title>The Special Lojban Characters</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>characters</primary><secondary>special</secondary></indexterm> The apostrophe, period, and comma need special attention.

    <quote>h</quote>, (IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[h]</phrase>). The letter 
    <quote>h</quote> is not used to represent this sound for two reasons: primarily in order to simplify explanations of the morphology, but also because the sound is very common, and the apostrophe is a visually lightweight representation of it. The apostrophe sound is a consonant in nature, but is not treated as either a consonant or a vowel for purposes of Lojban morphology (word-formation), which is explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-morphology"/>. In addition, the apostrophe visually parallels the comma and the period, which are also used (in different ways) to separate syllables.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>unvoiced vowel glide</primary><secondary>apostrophe as</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>apostrophe</primary><secondary>purpose of</secondary></indexterm> The apostrophe is included in Lojban only to enable a smooth transition between vowels, while joining the vowels within a single word. In fact, one way to think of the apostrophe is as representing an unvoiced vowel glide.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>apostrophe</primary><secondary>variant of</secondary></indexterm> As a permitted variant, any unvoiced fricative other than those already used in Lojban may be used to render the apostrophe: IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[θ]</phrase> is one possibility. The convenience of the listener should be regarded as paramount in deciding to use a substitute for 
    <phrase role="IPA">[h]</phrase>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>pause</primary><secondary>representation of in Lojban</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>glottal stop</primary><secondary>as pause in Lojban</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>period</primary><secondary>definition of</secondary></indexterm> The period represents a mandatory pause, with no specified length; a glottal stop (IPA 
    
    <phrase role="IPA">[ʔ]</phrase>) is considered a pause of shortest length. A pause (or glottal stop) may appear between any two words, and in certain cases &ndash; explained in detail in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-pauses"/> &ndash; must occur. In particular, a word beginning with a vowel is always preceded by a pause, and a word ending in a consonant is always followed by a pause.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>period</primary><secondary>optional</secondary></indexterm> Technically, the period is an optional reminder to the reader of a mandatory pause that is dictated by the rules of the language; because these rules are unambiguous, a missing period can be inferred from otherwise correct text. Periods are included only as an aid to the reader.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>period</primary><secondary>within a word</secondary></indexterm> A period also may be found apparently embedded in a word. When this occurs, such a written string is not one word but two, written together to indicate that the writer intends a unitary meaning for the compound. It is not really necessary to use a space between words if a period appears.</para>

Such a comma is written to separate syllables, but indicates that there must be no pause between them, in contrast to the period. Between two vowels, a comma indicates that some type of glide may be necessary to avoid a pause that would split the two syllables into separate words. It is always legal to use the apostrophe (IPA 
    
    <phrase role="IPA">[h]</phrase>) sound in pronouncing a comma. However, a comma cannot be pronounced as a pause or glottal stop between the two letters separated by the comma, because that pronunciation would split the word into two words.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>optional</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>main use of</secondary></indexterm> Otherwise, a comma is usually only used to clarify the presence of syllabic 
    <letteral>l</letteral>, 
    <letteral>m</letteral>, 
    <letteral>n</letteral>, or 
    <letteral>r</letteral> (discussed later). Commas are never required: no two Lojban words differ solely because of the presence or placement of a comma.</para>
    <para>   <indexterm type="general"><primary>period</primary><secondary>example of</secondary></indexterm> Here is a somewhat artificial example of the difference in pronunciation between periods, commas and apostrophes. In the English song about Old MacDonald's Farm, the vowel string which is written as 
    <quote>ee-i-ee-i-o</quote> in English could be Lojbanized with periods as:</para>
    <example role="pronunciation-example" xml:id="example-random-id-k2B4">

        <natlang>Ee! Eye! Ee! Eye! Oh!</natlang>
      </pronunciation>
    </example>
    <para>However, this would sound clipped, staccato, and unmusical compared to the English. Furthermore, although 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-k2B4"/> is a string of meaningful Lojban words, as a sentence it makes very little sense. (Note the use of periods embedded within the written word.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>example of</secondary></indexterm> If commas were used instead of periods, we could represent the English string as a Lojbanized name, ending in a consonant:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>variant of</secondary></indexterm> The commas represent new syllable breaks, but prohibit the use of pauses or glottal stop. The pronunciation shown is just one possibility, but closely parallels the intended English pronunciation.</para>
    
    <para>However, the use of commas in this way is risky to unambiguous interpretation, since the glides might be heard by some listeners as diphthongs, producing something like</para>
    <example role="pronunciation-example" xml:id="example-random-id-dQfn">

      </pronunciation>
    </example>
    <para>which is technically a different Lojban name. Since the intent with Lojbanized names is to allow them to be pronounced more like their native counterparts, the comma is allowed to represent vowel glides or some non-Lojbanic sound. Such an exception affects only spelling accuracy and the ability of a reader to replicate the desired pronunciation exactly; it will not affect the recognition of word boundaries.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>apostrophe</primary><secondary>as preferable over comma in names</secondary></indexterm> Still, it is better if Lojbanized names are always distinct. Therefore, the apostrophe is preferred in regular Lojbanized names that are not attempting to simulate a non-Lojban pronunciation perfectly. (Perfection, in any event, is not really achievable, because some sounds simply lack reasonable Lojbanic counterparts.)</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>diphthongs</primary><secondary>definition of</secondary></indexterm> There exist 16 diphthongs in the Lojban language. A diphthong is a vowel sound that consists of two elements, a short vowel sound and a glide, either a labial (IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[w]</phrase>) or palatal (IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[j]</phrase>) glide, that either precedes (an on-glide) or follows (an off-glide) the main vowel. Diphthongs always constitute a single syllable.</para>

Consonant sounds are relatively brief and normally require an accompanying vowel sound in order to be audible. Consonants may occur at the beginning or end of a syllable, around the vowel, and there may be several consonants in a cluster in either position. Each separate vowel sound constitutes a distinct syllable; consonant sounds do not affect the determination of syllables.</para>

Single consonant sounds are isolated by word boundaries or by intervening vowel sounds from other consonant sounds. Doubled consonant sounds are either lengthened like 
    <phrase role="IPA">[s]</phrase> in English 
    <quote>hiss</quote>, or repeated like 
    <phrase role="IPA">[k]</phrase> in English 
    <quote>backcourt</quote>. Consonant clusters consist of two or more single or doubled consonant sounds in a group, each of which is different from its immediate neighbor. In Lojban, doubled consonants are excluded altogether, and clusters are limited to two or three members, except in Lojbanized names.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>consonants</primary><secondary>position of</secondary></indexterm> Consonants can occur in three positions in words: initial (at the beginning), medial (in the middle), and final (at the end). In many languages, the sound of a consonant varies depending upon its position in the word. In Lojban, as much as possible, the sound of a consonant is unrelated to its position. In particular, the common American English trait of changing a 
    <quote>t</quote> between vowels into a 
    <quote>d</quote> or even an alveolar tap (IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ɾ]</phrase>) is unacceptable in Lojban.

As a result, the Lojban design allows the use of a buffer sound between consonant combinations which a speaker finds unpronounceable. This sound may be any non-Lojbanic vowel which is clearly separable by the listener from the Lojban vowels. Some possibilities are IPA 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ɪ]</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ɨ]</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ʊ]</phrase>, or even 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ʏ]</phrase>, but there probably is no universally acceptable buffer sound. When using a consonant buffer, the sound should be made as short as possible. Two examples showing such buffering (we will use 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ɪ]</phrase> in this chapter) are:</para>

The buffer vowel should be as laxly pronounced as possible, as central as possible, and as short as possible. Furthermore, it is worthwhile for speakers who use buffers to pronounce their regular vowels a bit longer than usual, to avoid confusion with buffer vowels. The speakers of many languages will have trouble correctly hearing any of the suggested buffer vowels otherwise. By this guideline,

Syllabication rules determine which of the consonants separating two vowels belong to the preceding vowel and which to the following vowel.

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>syllabication</primary><secondary>rules for</secondary></indexterm> A single consonant always belongs to the following vowel. A consonant pair is normally divided between the two vowels; however, if the pair constitute a valid initial consonant pair, they are normally both assigned to the following vowel. A consonant triple is divided between the first and second consonants. Apostrophes and commas, of course, also represent syllable breaks. Syllabic consonants usually appear alone in their syllables.</para>

Since every syllable has a vowel sound (or diphthong or syllabic consonant) as its nucleus, and the stress is on the vowel sound itself, the terms 
    <quote>stressed syllable</quote> and 
    <quote>stressed vowel</quote> are largely interchangeable concepts.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>stress</primary><secondary>rules for</secondary></indexterm> Most Lojban words are stressed on the next-to-the-last, or penultimate, syllable. In counting syllables, however, syllables whose vowel is 
    <letteral>y</letteral> or which contain a syllabic consonant ( 
    
    <letteral>l</letteral>, 
    <letteral>m</letteral>, 
    <letteral>n</letteral>, or 
    <letteral>r</letteral>) are never counted. (The Lojban term for penultimate stress is 
    <jbophrase>da'amoi terbasna</jbophrase>.) Similarly, syllables created solely by adding a buffer vowel, such as 
    <phrase role="IPA">[ɪ]</phrase>, are not counted.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>stress</primary><secondary>levels of</secondary></indexterm> There are actually three levels of stress &ndash; primary, secondary, and weak. Weak stress is the lowest level, so it really means no stress at all. Weak stress is required for syllables containing 
    <letteral>y</letteral>, a syllabic consonant, or a buffer vowel.</para>

    <valsi>brivla</valsi>). Lojbanized names may be stressed on any syllable, but if a syllable other than the penultimate is stressed, the syllable (or at least its vowel) must be capitalized in writing. Lojban structural words (called 
    <valsi>cmavo</valsi>) may be stressed on any syllable or none at all. However, primary stress may not be used in a syllable just preceding a brivla, unless a pause divides them; otherwise, the two words may run together.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>stress</primary><secondary>secondary</secondary></indexterm> Secondary stress is the optional and non-distinctive emphasis used for other syllables besides those required to have either weak or primary stress. There are few rules governing secondary stress, which typically will follow a speaker's native language habits or preferences. Secondary stress can be used for contrast, or for emphasis of a point. Secondary stress can be emphasized at any level up to primary stress, although the speaker must not allow a false primary stress in brivla, since errors in word resolution could result.</para>

Lojban's morphology is fairly simple compared to that of many languages, because Lojban words don't change form depending on how they are used. English has only a small number of such changes compared to languages like Russian, but it does have changes like 
    <quote>boys</quote> as the plural of 
    
    <quote>boy</quote>, or 
    <quote>walked</quote> as the past-tense form of 
    <quote>walk</quote>. To make plurals or past tenses in Lojban, you add separate words to the sentence that express the number of boys, or the time when the walking was going on.</para>

    <quote>derivational morphology</quote>: the capability of building new words from old words. In addition, the form of words tells us something about their grammatical uses, and sometimes about the means by which they entered the language. Lojban has very orderly rules for the formation of words of various types, both the words that already exist and new words yet to be created by speakers and writers.</para>

These three classes are called cmavo, brivla, and cmene. Each of these classes has uniquely identifying properties &ndash; an arrangement of letters that allows the word to be uniquely and unambiguously recognized as a separate word in a string of Lojban, upon either reading or hearing, and as belonging to a specific word-class.</para>
    
    
    <para>They are also functionally different: cmavo are the structure words, corresponding to English words like 
    
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>the</quote> and 
    <quote>to</quote>; brivla are the content words, corresponding to English words like 
    <quote>come</quote>, 
    <quote>red</quote>, 
    <quote>doctor</quote>, and

They are the structure words that hold the Lojban language together. They often have no semantic meaning in themselves, though they may affect the semantics of brivla to which they are attached. The cmavo include the equivalent of English articles, conjunctions, prepositions, numbers, and punctuation marks. There are over a hundred subcategories of cmavo, known as <valsi>selma'o</valsi>, each having a specifically defined grammatical usage. The various selma'o are discussed throughout

Lojban tanru are an elaboration of the concept of 
    <quote>metaphor</quote> used in English. In Lojban, any brivla can be used to modify another brivla. The first of the pair modifies the second. This modification is usually restrictive &ndash; the modifying brivla reduces the broader sense of the modified brivla to form a more narrow, concrete, or specific concept. Modifying brivla may thus be seen as acting like English adverbs or adjectives. For example,</para>

This is because there is no difference in meaning between the various rafsi for a gismu when they are used to build a lujvo.

    <quote>chalk</quote>) has no short rafsi and few lujvo.</para>
    <para>There are at most one CVC-form, one CCV-form, and one CVV-form rafsi per gismu. In fact, only a tiny handful of gismu have both a CCV-form and a CVV-form rafsi assigned, and still fewer have all three forms of short rafsi. However, gismu with both a CVC-form and another short rafsi are fairly common, partly because more possible CVC-form rafsi exist. Yet CVC-form rafsi, even though they are fairly easy to remember, cannot be used at the end of a lujvo (because lujvo must end in vowels), so justifying the assignment of an additional short rafsi to many gismu.</para>

    <quote>rafsi space</quote>- the set of all possible short rafsi forms &ndash; in the most efficient way possible; the goal is to make the most-used lujvo as short as possible (thus maximizing the use of short rafsi), while keeping the rafsi very recognizable to anyone who knows the source gismu. For this reason, the letters in a rafsi have always been chosen from among the five letters of the corresponding gismu. As a result, there are a limited set of short rafsi available for assignment to each gismu. At most seven possible short rafsi are available for consideration (of which at most three can be used, as explained above).</para>

As a brivla, a lujvo must also contain a consonant cluster within the first five letters &ndash; this ensures that they cannot be mistaken for compound cmavo. Of course, all lujvo have at least six letters since they have two or more rafsi, each at least three letters long; hence they cannot be confused with gismu.</para>

    <quote>hyphen</quote> always refers to a letter, either the vowel 
    <letteral>y</letteral> or one of the consonants 
    <letteral>r</letteral> and 
    <letteral>n</letteral>. (The letter

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo form</primary><secondary>requirements for y-hyphen insertion in</secondary></indexterm> The 
    y-hyphen is used after a CVC-form rafsi when joining it with the following rafsi could result in an impermissible consonant pair, or when the resulting lujvo could fall apart into two or more words (either cmavo or gismu).</para>

    <valsi>patyta'a</valsi>. Similarly, the tanru 
    <jbophrase>mudri siclu</jbophrase> ( 
    <quote>wooden whistle</quote>) cannot form the lujvo 
    <valsi valid="false">mudsiclu</valsi>; instead, 
    <valsi>mudysiclu</valsi> must be used. (Remember that 
    <letteral>y</letteral> is not counted in determining whether the first five letters of a brivla contain a consonant cluster: this is why.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>rafsi</primary><secondary>four-letter</secondary><tertiary>requirement for y-hyphen</tertiary></indexterm> The 
    y-hyphen is also used to attach a 4-letter rafsi, formed by dropping the final vowel of a gismu, to the following rafsi. (This procedure was shown, but not explained, in

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjbP"/>.)</para>

    r-hyphen and its close relative, the 
    n-hyphen, are used in lujvo only after CVV-form rafsi. A hyphen is always required in a two-part lujvo of the form CVV-CVV, since otherwise there would be no consonant cluster.</para>
    <para>An 
    r-hyphen or 
    n-hyphen is also required after the CVV-form rafsi of any lujvo of the form CVV-CVC/CV or CVV-CCVCV since it would otherwise fall apart into a CVV-form cmavo and a gismu. In any lujvo with more than two parts, a CVV-form rafsi in the initial position must always be followed by a hyphen. If the hyphen were to be omitted, the supposed lujvo could be broken into smaller words without the hyphen: because the CVV-form rafsi would be interpreted as a cmavo, and the remainder of the word as a valid lujvo that is one rafsi shorter.</para>

    <jbophrase valid="false">ro'irre'o</jbophrase> (which has an impermissible double consonant); the 
    n-hyphen is required, and the correct form of the hyphenated lujvo is 
    <valsi>ro'inre'o</valsi>. The same lujvo could also be expressed without hyphenation as 
    <valsi>rokre'o</valsi>.</para>

    <quote>brie</quote> or 
    
    <quote>cobra</quote>), or for jargon words specialized to a narrow field (e.g. 
    
    
    <quote>quark</quote>, 
    
    <quote>integral</quote>, or 
    
    <quote>iambic pentameter</quote>). These words are in effect names for concepts, and the names were invented by speakers of another language. The vast majority of words referring to plants, animals, foods, and scientific terminology cannot be easily expressed as tanru. They thus must be borrowed (actually 
    
    <quote>copied</quote>) into Lojban from the original language.</para>

    <quote>copied</quote>, hence the Lojban tanru 
    <jbophrase>fukpi valsi</jbophrase>) from the other language and Lojbanized &ndash; the phonemes are converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications are made as necessary to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word. All fu'ivla:</para>

    <cmevla>meris.</cmevla>, 
    <cmevla>maris.</cmevla>, 
    <cmevla>meiris.</cmevla>, 
    <cmevla>merix.</cmevla>, or even

These minor restrictions are due to the fact that all Lojban cmene embedded in a speech stream will be preceded by one of these words or by a pause. With one of these words embedded, the cmene might break up into valid Lojban words followed by a shorter cmene. However, break-up cannot happen after a consonant, because that would imply that the word before the

    <title>Considerations for making lujvo</title>
    <para>Given a tanru which expresses an idea to be used frequently, it can be turned into a lujvo by following the lujvo-making algorithm which is given in 
    <xref linkend="section-lujvo-making"/>.</para>
    <para>In building a lujvo, the first step is to replace each gismu with a rafsi that uniquely represents that gismu. These rafsi are then attached together by fixed rules that allow the resulting compound to be recognized as a single word and to be analyzed in only one way.</para>
    <para>There are three other complications; only one is serious.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>rafsi</primary><secondary>multiple for each gismu</secondary></indexterm> The first is that there is usually more than one rafsi that can be used for each gismu. The one to be used is simply whichever one sounds or looks best to the speaker or writer. There are usually many valid combinations of possible rafsi. They all are equally valid, and all of them mean exactly the same thing. (The scoring algorithm given in 
    <xref linkend="section-lujvo-scoring"/> is used to choose the standard form of the lujvo &ndash; the version which would be entered into a dictionary.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>linguistic drift in Lojban</primary><secondary>possible source of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>consideration in choosing meaning for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>unambiguity of</secondary></indexterm> The second complication is the serious one. Remember that a tanru is ambiguous &ndash; it has several possible meanings. A lujvo, or at least one that would be put into the dictionary, has just a single meaning. Like a gismu, a lujvo is a predicate which encompasses one area of the semantic universe, with one set of places. Hopefully the meaning chosen is the most useful of the possible semantic spaces. A possible source of linguistic drift in Lojban is that as Lojbanic society evolves, the concept that seems the most useful one may change.</para>
    
    
    <para><indexterm type="general"><primary>za'e</primary><secondary>use to avoid lujvo misunderstandings</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>meaning drift of</secondary></indexterm> You must also be aware of the possibility of some prior meaning of a new lujvo, especially if you are writing for posterity. If a lujvo is invented which involves the same tanru as one that is in the dictionary, and is assigned a different meaning (or even just a different place structure), linguistic drift results. This isn't necessarily bad. Every natural language does it. But in communication, when you use a meaning different from the dictionary definition, someone else may use the dictionary and therefore misunderstand you. You can use the cmavo 
    
    <valsi>za'e</valsi> (explained in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-bahe"/>) before a newly coined lujvo to indicate that it may have a non-dictionary meaning.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>ultimate guideline for choice of meaning/place-structure</secondary></indexterm> The essential nature of human communication is that if the listener understands, then all is well. Let this be the ultimate guideline for choosing meanings and place structures for invented lujvo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>dropping elements of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Zipf's Law</primary></indexterm> The third complication is also simple, but tends to scare new Lojbanists with its implications. It is based on Zipf's Law, which says that the length of words is inversely proportional to their usage. The shortest words are those which are used more; the longest ones are used less. Conversely, commonly used concepts will be tend to be abbreviated. In English, we have abbreviations and acronyms and jargon, all of which represent complex ideas that are used often by small groups of people, so they shortened them to convey more information more rapidly.</para>
    
    
    
    <para>Therefore, given a complicated tanru with grouping markers, abstraction markers, and other cmavo in it to make it syntactically unambiguous, the psychological basis of Zipf's Law may compel the lujvo-maker to drop some of the cmavo to make a shorter (technically incorrect) tanru, and then use that tanru to make the lujvo.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>based on multiple tanru</secondary></indexterm> This doesn't lead to ambiguity, as it might seem to. A given lujvo still has exactly one meaning and place structure. It is just that more than one tanru is competing for the same lujvo. But more than one meaning for the tanru was already competing for the 
    <quote>right</quote> to define the meaning of the lujvo. Someone has to use judgment in deciding which one meaning is to be chosen over the others.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>shorter for more general concepts</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>considerations for retaining elements of</secondary></indexterm> If the lujvo made by a shorter form of tanru is in use, or is likely to be useful for another meaning, the decider then retains one or more of the cmavo, preferably ones that set this meaning apart from the shorter form meaning that is used or anticipated. As a rule, therefore, the shorter lujvo will be used for a more general concept, possibly even instead of a more frequent word. If both words are needed, the simpler one should be shorter. It is easier to add a cmavo to clarify the meaning of the more complex term than it is to find a good alternate tanru for the simpler term.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>and plausibility</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>and the listener</secondary></indexterm> And of course, we have to consider the listener. On hearing an unknown word, the listener will decompose it and get a tanru that makes no sense or the wrong sense for the context. If the listener realizes that the grouping operators may have been dropped out, he or she may try alternate groupings, or try inserting an abstraction operator if that seems plausible. (The grouping of tanru is explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/>; abstraction is explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-abstractions"/>.) Plausibility is the key to learning new ideas and to evaluating unfamiliar lujvo.</para>

    <para>This algorithm was devised by Bob and Nora LeChevalier in 1989. It is not the only possible algorithm, but it usually gives a choice that people find preferable. The algorithm may be changed in the future. The lowest-scoring variant will usually be the dictionary form of the lujvo. (In previous versions, it was the highest-scoring variant.)</para>

    <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>scored examples of</secondary></indexterm> In case of ties, there is no preference. This should be rare. Note that the algorithm essentially encodes a hierarchy of priorities: short words are preferred (counting apostrophes as half a letter), then words with fewer hyphens, words with more pleasing rafsi (this judgment is subjective), and finally words with more vowels are chosen. Each decision principle is applied in turn if the ones before it have failed to choose; it is possible that a lower-ranked principle might dominate a higher-ranked one if it is ten times better than the alternative.</para>

    <para>
<indexterm type="general"><primary>doghouse</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
This section contains examples of making and scoring lujvo. First, we will start with the tanru 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> ( 
    <quote>dog house</quote>) and construct a lujvo meaning 
    
    
    <quote>doghouse</quote>, that is, a house where a dog lives. We will use a brute-force application of the algorithm in 
    <xref linkend="section-lujvo-scoring"/>, using every possible rafsi.</para>
    <para>The rafsi for 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> are:</para>
    <simplelist type="horiz" columns="4">
      <member><rafsi>-ger-</rafsi>, </member>
      <member><rafsi>-ge'u-</rafsi>, </member>
      <member><rafsi>-gerk-</rafsi>, </member>
      <member><rafsi>-gerku</rafsi></member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>The rafsi for 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> are:</para>
    <simplelist type="horiz" columns="3">
      <member><rafsi>-zda-</rafsi>, </member>
      <member><rafsi>-zdan-</rafsi>, </member>
      <member><rafsi>-zdani</rafsi>.</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>Step 1 of the algorithm directs us to use 
    <rafsi>-ger-</rafsi>, 
    <rafsi>-ge'u-</rafsi> and 
    <rafsi>-gerk-</rafsi> as possible rafsi for 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>; Step 2 directs us to use 
    <rafsi>-zda-</rafsi> and 
    <rafsi>-zdani</rafsi> as possible rafsi for 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. The six possible forms of the lujvo are then:</para>
    <simplelist type="vert" columns="1">
      <member><rafsi>ger</rafsi><rafsi>-zda</rafsi></member>
      <member><rafsi>ger</rafsi><rafsi>-zdani</rafsi></member>
      <member><rafsi>ge'u</rafsi><rafsi>-zda</rafsi></member>
      <member><rafsi>ge'u</rafsi><rafsi>-zdani</rafsi></member>
      <member><rafsi>gerk</rafsi><rafsi>-zda</rafsi></member>
      <member><rafsi>gerk</rafsi><rafsi>-zdani</rafsi></member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>We must then insert appropriate hyphens in each case. The first two forms need no hyphenation: 
    
    <valsi>ge</valsi> cannot fall off the front, because the following word would begin with 
    <morphology>rz</morphology>, which is not a permissible initial consonant pair. So the lujvo forms are 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> and 
    <valsi>gerzdani</valsi>.</para>
    <para>The third form, 
    <rafsi>ge'u</rafsi><rafsi>-zda</rafsi>, needs no hyphen, because even though the first rafsi is CVV, the second one is CCV, so there is a consonant cluster in the first five letters. So 
    <valsi>ge'uzda</valsi> is this form of the lujvo.</para>
    <para>The fourth form, 
    <valsi valid="false">ge'u-zdani</valsi>, however, requires an 
    r-hyphen; otherwise, the 
    <rafsi>ge'u-</rafsi> part would fall off as a cmavo. So this form of the lujvo is 
    <valsi>ge'urzdani</valsi>.</para>
    <para>The last two forms require 
    y-hyphens, as all 4-letter rafsi do, and so are 
    
    <valsi>gerkyzda</valsi> and 
    <valsi>gerkyzdani</valsi> respectively.</para>
    <para> 

<indexterm type="general"><primary>boat class</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

 The scoring algorithm is heavily weighted in favor of short lujvo, so we might expect that 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> would win. Its <varname>L</varname> score is 6, its <varname>A</varname> score is 0, its <varname>H</varname> score is 0, its <varname>R</varname> score is 12, and its <varname>V</varname> score is 3, for a final score of 5878. The other forms have scores of 7917, 6367, 9506, 8008, and 10047 respectively. Consequently, this lujvo would probably appear in the dictionary in the form 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi>.</para>
    <para>For the next example, we will use the tanru 
    <jbophrase>bloti klesi</jbophrase> ( 
    <quote>boat class</quote>) presumably referring to the category (rowboat, motorboat, cruise liner) into which a boat falls. We will omit the long rafsi from the process, since lujvo containing long rafsi are almost never preferred by the scoring algorithm when there are short rafsi available.</para>
    <para>The rafsi for 
    <valsi>bloti</valsi> are 
    <rafsi>-lot-</rafsi>, 
    <rafsi>-blo-</rafsi>, and 
    <rafsi>-lo'i-</rafsi>; for 
    <valsi>klesi</valsi> they are 
    <rafsi>-kle-</rafsi> and 
    <rafsi>-lei-</rafsi>. Both these gismu are among the handful which have both CVV-form and CCV-form rafsi, so there is an unusual number of possibilities available for a two-part tanru:</para>
    <simplelist type="horiz" columns="3">
      <member><valsi>lotkle</valsi></member>
      <member><valsi>blokle</valsi></member>
      <member><valsi>lo'ikle</valsi></member>
      
      <member><valsi>lotlei</valsi></member>
      <member><valsi>blolei</valsi></member>
      <member><valsi>lo'irlei</valsi></member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>Only 
    <valsi>lo'irlei</valsi> requires hyphenation (to avoid confusion with the cmavo sequence 
    <jbophrase>lo'i lei</jbophrase>). All six forms are valid versions of the lujvo, as are the six further forms using long rafsi; however, the scoring algorithm produces the following results:</para>
    <informaltable>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>lotkle</valsi></td>
            <td>5878</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>blokle</valsi></td>
            <td>5858</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>lo'ikle</valsi></td>
            <td>6367</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>lotlei</valsi></td>
            <td>5867</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>blolei</valsi></td>
            <td>5847</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><valsi>lo'irlei</valsi></td>
            <td>7456</td>
          </tr>
    </informaltable>
    <para> 

<indexterm type="general"><primary>Logical Language Group</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

 So the form 
    <valsi>blolei</valsi> is preferred, but only by a tiny margin over 
    <valsi>blokle</valsi>; "lotlei" and "lotkle" are only slightly worse; 
    <valsi>lo'ikle</valsi> suffers because of its apostrophe, and 
    <valsi>lo'irlei</valsi> because of having both apostrophe and hyphen.</para>
    <para>Our third example will result in forming both a lujvo and a name from the tanru 
    <jbophrase>logji bangu girzu</jbophrase>, or 
    <quote>logical-language group</quote> in English. ( 
    <quote>The Logical Language Group</quote> is the name of the publisher of this book and the organization for the promotion of Lojban.)</para>

    <valsi>nakykemcinctu</valsi> is the shortest and is preferred by the scoring algorithm. On the whole, however, it might be better to just make a lujvo for 
    <jbophrase>cinse ctuca</jbophrase> (which would be 
    <valsi>cinctu</valsi>) since the sex of the teacher is rarely important. If there was a reason to specify 
    <quote>male</quote>, then the simpler tanru 
    <jbophrase>nakni cinctu</jbophrase> ( 
    <quote>male sexual-teacher</quote>) would be appropriate. This tanru is actually shorter than the four-part lujvo, since the

    <title>The gismu creation algorithm</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>source languages</primary><secondary>use in creating gismu</secondary></indexterm> The gismu were created through the following process:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>creation</secondary><tertiary>scoring rules</tertiary></indexterm> At least one word was found in each of the six source languages (Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, Arabic) corresponding to the proposed gismu. This word was rendered into Lojban phonetics rather liberally: consonant clusters consisting of a stop and the corresponding fricative were simplified to just the fricative (
        <morphology>tc</morphology> became 
        <letteral>c</letteral>, 
        <morphology>dj</morphology> became 
        <letteral>j</letteral>) and non-Lojban vowels were mapped onto Lojban ones. Furthermore, morphological endings were dropped. The same mapping rules were applied to all six languages for the sake of consistency.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All possible gismu forms were matched against the six source-language forms. The matches were scored as follows: 
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If three or more letters were the same in the proposed gismu and the source-language word, and appeared in the same order, the score was equal to the number of letters that were the same. Intervening letters, if any, did not matter.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>If exactly two letters were the same in the proposed gismu and the source-language word, and either the two letters were consecutive in both words, or were separated by a single letter in both words, the score was 2. Letters in reversed order got no score.</para>

(Second-language speakers were reckoned at half their actual numbers.) The weights were chosen to sum to 1.00. The sum of the weighted scores was the total score for the proposed gismu form.</para>

        <para>Any gismu forms that conflicted with existing gismu were removed. Obviously, being identical with an existing gismu constitutes a conflict. In addition, a proposed gismu that was identical to an existing gismu except for the final vowel was considered a conflict, since two such gismu would have identical 4-letter rafsi.</para>
        <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>creation</secondary><tertiary>and transcription blunders</tertiary></indexterm> More subtly: If the proposed gismu was identical to an existing gismu except for a single consonant, and the consonant was "too similar” based on the following table, then the proposed gismu was rejected.</para>

    <para>The following gismu were not made by the gismu creation algorithm. They are, in effect, coined words similar to fu'ivla. They are exceptions to the otherwise mandatory gismu creation algorithm where there was sufficient justification for such exceptions. Except for the small metric prefixes and the assignable predicates beginning with 
    <rafsi>brod-</rafsi>, they all end in the letter 
    <letteral>o</letteral>, which is otherwise a rare letter in Lojban gismu.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>scientific-mathematical</secondary></indexterm> The following gismu represent concepts that are sufficiently unique to Lojban that they were either coined from combining forms of other gismu, or else made up out of whole cloth. These gismu are thus conceptually similar to lujvo even though they are only five letters long; however, unlike lujvo, they have rafsi assigned to them for use in building more complex lujvo. Assigning gismu to these concepts helps to keep the resulting lujvo reasonably short.</para>

    <para>Finally, there are the cultural gismu, which are also borrowed, but by modifying a word from one particular language, instead of using the multi-lingual gismu creation algorithm. Cultural gismu are used for words that have local importance to a particular culture; other cultures or languages may have no word for the concept at all, or may borrow the word from its home culture, just as Lojban does. In such a case, the gismu algorithm, which uses weighted averages, doesn't accurately represent the frequency of usage of the individual concept. Cultural gismu are not even required to be based on the six major languages.</para>

    <title>rafsi fu'ivla: a proposal</title>
    <para>The list of cultures represented by gismu, given in 
    <xref linkend="section-cultural-gismu"/>, is unavoidably controversial. Much time has been spent debating whether this or that culture 
    <quote>deserves a gismu</quote> or 
    <quote>must languish in fu'ivla space</quote>. To help defuse this argument, a last-minute proposal was made when this book was already substantially complete. I have added it here with experimental status: it is not yet a standard part of Lojban, since all its implications have not been tested in open debate, and it affects a part of the language (lujvo-making) that has long been stable, but is known to be fragile in the face of small changes. (Many attempts were made to add general mechanisms for making lujvo that contained fu'ivla, but all failed on obvious or obscure counterexamples; finally the general 
    <valsi>zei</valsi> mechanism was devised instead.)</para>
    <para>The first part of the proposal is uncontroversial and involves no change to the language mechanisms. All valid Type 4 fu'ivla of the form CCVVCV would be reserved for cultural brivla analogous to those described in 
    <xref linkend="section-cultural-gismu"/>. For example,</para>

    <para>  is of the appropriate form, and passes all tests required of a Stage 4 fu'ivla. No two fu'ivla of this form would be allowed to coexist if they differed only in the final vowel; this rule was applied to gismu, but does not apply to other fu'ivla or to lujvo.</para>
    <para>The second, and fully experimental, part of the proposal is to allow rafsi to be formed from these cultural fu'ivla by removing the final vowel and treating the result as a 4-letter rafsi (although it would contain five letters, not four). These rafsi could then be used on a par with all other rafsi in forming lujvo. The tanru</para>

    <para>which is an illegal word in standard Lojban, but a valid lujvo under this proposal. There would be no short rafsi or 5-letter rafsi assigned to any fu'ivla, so no fu'ivla could appear as the last element of a lujvo.</para>
    <para>The cultural fu'ivla introduced under this proposal are called 
    <jbophrase>rafsi fu'ivla</jbophrase>, since they are distinguished from other Type 4 fu'ivla by the property of having rafsi. If this proposal is workable and introduces no problems into Lojban morphology, it might become standard for all Type 4 fu'ivla, including those made for plants, animals, foodstuffs, and other things.</para>

There are three different varieties of brivla: those which are built into the language (the gismu), those which are derived from combinations of the gismu (the lujvo), and those which are taken (usually in a modified form) from other languages (the fu'ivla). In addition, there are a few cmavo that can act like brivla; these are mentioned in 
    <xref linkend="section-cmavo-selbri"/>, and discussed in full in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-anaphoric-cmavo"/>.</para>

When a selbri is built in this way from more than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English are combinations of two nouns such as 
    <quote>lemon tree</quote>. There is no way to tell just by looking at the phrase 
    <quote>lemon tree</quote> exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of 
    <quote>lemon</quote> and 
    <quote>tree</quote> by themselves. As English-speakers, we must simply know that it refers to 
    <quote>a tree which bears lemons as fruits</quote>. A person who didn't know English very well might think of it as analogous to 
    <quote>brown tree</quote> and wonder, 
    <quote>What kind of tree is lemon-colored?</quote></para>

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>adjective ordering</primary></indexterm> much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of the English phrase is that the dog is big as compared with other dogs, not merely as compared with other red dogs.

    <quote>red big dog</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>in tanru</secondary></indexterm> The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the cmavo 
    <valsi>je</valsi>, which is one of the many equivalents of English 
    <quote>and</quote>. A big red dog is one that is both big and red, and we can say:</para>

    <para>A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like

    <para>whereas the interpretation specified by 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-aFxm"/> does not. This is a kind of semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm resolution. The way in which the school is said to be of type 
    <quote>beautiful and girl</quote> may entail that it is separately a beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful and girls, is also possible. Still another interpretation is:</para>

      <para>That is a school for beautiful things and also for girls.</para>

    <para>The question of the place structures of selbri has been glossed over so far. This chapter does not attempt to treat place structure issues in detail; they are discussed in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti-tcita"/>. One grammatical structure related to places belongs here, however. In simple sentences such as 
    <xref linkend="example-do-mamta-mi"/>, the place structure of the selbri is simply the defined place structure of the gismu
    <valsi>mamta</valsi>. What about more complex selbri?</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>place structures of</secondary></indexterm> For tanru, the place structure rule is simple: the place structure of a tanru is always the place structure of its tertau. Thus, the place structure of 
    <jbophrase>blanu zdani</jbophrase> is that of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>: the x1 place is a house or nest, and the x2 place is its occupants.</para>
    <para>What about the places of 
    <valsi>blanu</valsi>? Is there any way to get them into the act? In fact, 
    <valsi>blanu</valsi> has only one place, and this is merged, as it were, with the x1 place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. It is whatever is in the x1 place that is being characterized as blue-for-a-house. But if we replace 
    <valsi>blanu</valsi> with

    <para>  Note that in Lojban 
    <quote>trying to go</quote> is expressed using

    <valsi>mi</valsi> fills the x1 place of

    <para>As a result, the regular mechanisms (involving selma'o VOhA and GOhI, explained in

    </example>
    <para>the cmavo 
    <valsi>pu</valsi> specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tenses"/>. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-uz13"/>. There are alternative ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti-tcita"/>, behave in the same way as tenses.</para>
    <para>Similarly, a bridi may have the particle 
    <valsi>na</valsi> (of selma'o NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar negation of 
    <xref linkend="section-selbri-scalar-negation"/>. For example:</para>

    <valsi>je</valsi> or 
    <valsi>je</valsi><valsi>bo</valsi> for logical connection. Most of these are definitely not plausible interpretations of the English phrase 
    <quote>pretty little girls' school</quote>, especially those which describe something which is both a girl and a school.</para>
    <para>Examples <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjmr"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjNi"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjog"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjop"/>, and <xref linkend="example-random-id-tz0L"/> are repeated here as Examples <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjzw"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKaM"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKfX"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKmg"/>, and <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKPQ"/> respectively.

        The seven examples following each of these share the same grouping pattern, but differ in the presence or absence of 
    <valsi>je</valsi> at each possible site. Some of the examples have more than one Lojban version. In that case, they differ only in grouping mechanism, and are always equivalent in meaning.</para>
    <para>The logical connective 
    <valsi>je</valsi> is associative: that is, 
    <quote>A and (B and C)</quote> is the same as 
    <quote>(A and B) and C</quote>. Therefore, some of the examples have the same meaning as others. In particular, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKAG"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKFA"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKLN"/>, <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKpo"/>, and <xref linkend="example-random-id-qKU6"/> all have the same meaning because all four brivla are logically connected and the grouping is simply irrelevant.
    <!-- was: In particular, 16.8, 16.16, 16.24, 16.32, and 16.40 all have the same meaning -->
    Other equivalent forms are noted in the examples themselves. However, if 
    
    <valsi>je</valsi> were replaced by 
    <valsi>naja</valsi> or 
    <valsi>jo</valsi> or most of the other logical connectives, the meanings would become distinct.</para>

    <para>Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions. Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-anaphoric-cmavo"/>, 
    <xref linkend="chapter-mekso"/>, and 
    <xref linkend="chapter-structure"/> respectively, so this chapter only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See

    <xref linkend="chapter-relative-clauses"/>. However, most descriptions have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE or LA, and a selbri. (The difference between selma'o LE and selma'o LA is not important until 
    <xref linkend="section-names"/>.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla. Here is an elementary example:</para>

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>le</primary><secondary>compared with English the</secondary></indexterm> The long gloss for 
    <valsi>le</valsi> is of course far too long to use most of the time, and in fact 
    
    <valsi>le</valsi> is quite close in meaning to English

    <valsi>le</valsi> is twofold. First, it indicates that the speaker has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are). Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing the things he or she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>plurals</primary><secondary>Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking</secondary></indexterm> Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to markets is to just one ( 
    <quote>the market</quote>) or to more than one ( 
    <quote>the markets</quote>). Lojban requires no such forced choice, so both colloquial translations of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-ULGC"/> are valid. Only the context can specify which is meant. (This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained in

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>le</primary><secondary>in false-to-fact descriptions</secondary></indexterm> 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-PutX"/> is not self-contradictory in Lojban, because 
    <jbophrase>le nanmu</jbophrase> merely means something or other which, for my present purposes, I choose to describe as a man, whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would be: someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out to be actually a woman on closer observation. 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-PutX"/> is what I would say to point out my observation to you.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>descriptions</primary><secondary>specific</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>specific descriptions</primary></indexterm> In all descriptions with 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, the listener is presumed to either know what I have in mind or else not to be concerned at present (perhaps I will give more identifying details later). In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or men: 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-PutX"/> would then be perfectly intelligible, since 
    <jbophrase>le nanmu</jbophrase> merely clarifies that I am pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape, or a nose, which happens to lie in the same direction.</para>

The effect of using 
    <valsi>lo</valsi> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-t11z"/> is to refer generally to one or more markets, without being specific about which. Unlike 
    <jbophrase>le zarci</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>lo zarci</jbophrase> must refer to something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is

    <para>English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to be more attached to the sound of our names than their meaning, even if the meaning (etymological or current) is known. Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of fact,

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-93Yv"/> is about one or more of the really existing, objectively defined bears. In either case, though, each of them must have contributed to the writing of the story, if more than one bear (or

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>descriptions with lo</primary><secondary>teddy bear contrasted with real bear</secondary></indexterm> (The notion of a 
    <quote>really existing, objectively defined bear</quote> raises certain difficulties. Is a panda bear a 
    <quote>real bear</quote>? How about a teddy bear? In general, the answer is

Using the mass descriptor 
    
    <valsi>lei</valsi> signals that ordinary logical reasoning is not applicable: contradictions can be maintained, and all sorts of other peculiarities may exist.

(Note that the operation of forming a mass entity does not imply, in Lojban, that the components of the mass are necessarily close to one another or even related in any way other than conceptually.

    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

    </cmavo-list>
    <para>Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-mekso"/>. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers 
    <valsi>pa</valsi>, 
    <valsi>re</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ci</valsi>, 
    <valsi>vo</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>mu</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>one</quote>, 
    <quote>two</quote>, 
    <quote>three</quote>, 
    <quote>four</quote>, 
    <quote>five</quote> respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it &ndash; which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, 
    <valsi>piro</valsi> and 
    <valsi>pisu'o</valsi>, are explained in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-quantified-descriptions"/>.)</para>
    <para>Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:</para>

    </example>
    <para>The difference between 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qL61"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLAH"/> is the presence of the explicit quantifier 
    <valsi>re</valsi> in the latter example. Although 
    <valsi>re</valsi> by itself means 
    <quote>two</quote>, when used as a quantifier it means 
    <quote>two-of</quote>. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be 
    <quote>walkers on the ice</quote>. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say 
    <quote>I own three shoes</quote> if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.</para>
    <para>(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence</para>

    <para>Now consider

This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as 
    
    <valsi>mi</valsi> and 
    <valsi>mi'o</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ko</valsi> obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called

    <para>the meaning would be something like

Because lo-series descriptors always refer to all of the things which really fit into the x1 place of the selbri. They are not restricted by the speaker's intention. Descriptors of the le-series, however, are so restricted, and therefore talk about some number, definite or indefinite, of objects the speaker has in mind &ndash; but never less than one.</para>

In the case of mass and set descriptors, a single rule suffices for each: reference to a mass is implicitly a reference to some part of the mass; reference to a set is implicitly a reference to the whole set. Masses and sets are inherently singular objects: it makes no sense to talk about two distinct masses with the same components, or two distinct sets with the same members. Therefore, the largest possible outer quantifier for either a set description or a mass description is 
    <valsi>piro</valsi>, the whole of it.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>plural masses</primary><secondary>possible use for</secondary></indexterm> (Pedantically, it is possible that the mass of water molecules composing an ice cube might be thought of as different from the same mass of water molecules in liquid form, in which case we might talk about

    <valsi>piro</valsi> means a portion consisting of the all-ness &ndash; the entirety &ndash; of a thing. Similarly, 
    <valsi>pisu'o</valsi> specifies a portion consisting of at least one part of a thing, i.e. some of it.</para>

Thus 
    
    <jbophrase>pimu le'i nanmu</jbophrase> is a subset of the set of men I have in mind; we don't know precisely which elements make up this subset, but it must have half the size of the full set. This is the best way to say 
    <quote>half of the men</quote>; saying 
    <jbophrase>pimu le nanmu</jbophrase> would give us a half-portion of one of them instead! Of course, the result of 
    <jbophrase>pimu le'i nanmu</jbophrase> is still a set; if you need to refer to the individuals of the subset, you must say so (see 
    <valsi>lu'a</valsi> in

    <valsi>la</valsi>, and the typical descriptors 
    <valsi>le'e</valsi> and 
    <valsi>lo'e</valsi>) is special. When we refer to specific individuals with 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, we mean to refer to all of those we have in mind, so 
    <valsi>ro</valsi> is appropriate as the implicit quantifier, just as it is appropriate for 
    <valsi>do</valsi>. Reference to non-specific individuals with

    <para>looks very peculiar. Why is the number 
    <valsi>ci</valsi> found as an inner quantifier in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-f643"/> and as an outer quantifier in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gr7Y"/>? The number of dogs is the same in either case. The answer is that the 
    <valsi>ci</valsi> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-f643"/> is part of the specification: it tells us the actual number of dogs in the group that the speaker has in mind. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gr7Y"/>, however, the dogs referred to by 
    <jbophrase>... lo gerku</jbophrase> are all the dogs that exist: the outer quantifier then restricts the number to three; which three, we cannot tell. The implicit quantifiers are chosen to avoid claiming too much or too little: in the case of 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, the implicit outer quantifier 
    <valsi>ro</valsi> says that each of the dogs in the restricted group is white; in the case of 
    <valsi>lo</valsi>, the implicit inner quantifier simply says that three dogs, chosen from the group of all the dogs there are, are white.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lo-series description</primary><secondary>caution on exact numbers as inner quantifiers on</secondary></indexterm> Using exact numbers as inner quantifiers in lo-series descriptions is dangerous, because you are stating that exactly that many things exist which really fit the description. So examples like</para>

    <para>are semantically anomalous; 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-uYH4"/> claims that some dog (or dogs) is white, but also that there are just three dogs in the universe!</para>
    <para>Nevertheless, inner quantifiers are permitted on 
    <valsi>lo</valsi> descriptors for consistency's sake, and may occasionally be useful.</para>
    <para>Note that the inner quantifier of 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, even when exact, need not be truthful: 
    <jbophrase>le ci nanmu</jbophrase> means 
    <quote>what I describe as three men</quote>, not 
    <quote>three of what I describe as men</quote>. This follows from the rule that what is described by a 
    <valsi>le</valsi> description represents the speaker's viewpoint rather than the objective way things are.</para>

    <title>sumti-based descriptions</title>
    <para>As stated in 
    <xref linkend="section-basic-descriptors"/>, most descriptions consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter, the selbri have always been single gismu, but of course any selbri, however complex, can be employed in a description. The syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/>.) In the intervening sections, inner and outer quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now it is time to discuss a description of a radically different kind: the sumti-based description.</para>

    <quote>pro-sumti</quote>. A purely Lojban term would be 
    <jbophrase>sumti cmavo</jbophrase>: all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In exactly the same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to selma'o GOhA) which serve as selbri or full bridi. These may be called 
    <quote>pro-bridi</quote> or 
    <jbophrase>bridi cmavo</jbophrase>. This chapter explains the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall into a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o KOhA, we have among others the mi-series, the ko'a-series, the da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of pro-sumti is explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi, it is explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't have pro-bridi analogues, however.</para>

    <quote>referent</quote> means the thing to which a pro-sumti (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the speaker of a sentence is James, then the referent of the word 
    <quote>I</quote> is James. On the other hand, the term 
    <quote>antecedent</quote> refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi) implicitly repeats. In</para>

In English, the words 
    <quote>this</quote> and 
    <quote>that</quote> serve this function among others: 
    <quote>this</quote> refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and 
    <quote>that</quote> refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo 
    <valsi>ti</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ta</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> provide only the pointing function of 
    <quote>this</quote> and

Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century, English did too; the pronoun 
    <quote>that</quote> referred to something at a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun 
    <quote>yon</quote> to something far away.</para>

    <valsi>ta</valsi> and 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, 
    <valsi>ta</valsi> refers to something that is near the listener, whereas 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> and 
    <valsi>mi</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>ta</valsi> and 
    <valsi>do</valsi>, that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what counts as 
    <quote>near</quote> and 
    <quote>far away</quote> is relative to the current situation.</para>

    <letteral>u</letteral> vowel convention of the demonstratives in

    <jbophrase>le zarci</jbophrase>. To a Lojbanist, however,

    <para>The term 
    <quote>anaphora</quote> literally means 
    
    <quote>repetition</quote>, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, 
    
    <valsi>ri</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ra</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>ru</valsi>; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, 
    
    <valsi>go'i</valsi>, 
    <valsi>go'a</valsi>, and 
    
    <valsi>go'u</valsi>. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the 
    
    <quote>distances</quote> referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note that 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> does not repeat 
    <jbophrase>le ri kumfa</jbophrase>, because that sumti is not yet complete when 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> appears. This prevents 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like 
    <jbophrase>la alis.</jbophrase> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-bs5R"/> is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.</para>
    <para>Certain sumti are ignored by 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:</para>

    </example>
    <para>However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>, because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> may not be effective. Likewise, 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>; in fact, a string of 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:</para>

    <para>Here

    <jbophrase>lo forca</jbophrase> to reach

    <para>Therefore, the vaguer 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> are also provided. The cmavo 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> repeats a recently used sumti, and 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> refer to the last sumti, like 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>? The answer is no if 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> has also been used. If 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> has not been used, then 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> might be the last sumti. Likewise, if 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> has been used, then any use of 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> would repeat a sumti earlier than the one 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example <xref linkend="example-random-id-Lc2y"/>, but one that depends more on context, is:</para>

        <gloss>A spoon. A fork. Rick uses [some previous thing]. Alice uses [some more remote thing].</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-N89g"/>, the use of 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> tells us that something other than 
    <jbophrase>la rik.</jbophrase> is the antecedent; 
    <jbophrase>lo forca</jbophrase> is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> must be something even further back in the utterance than 
    <jbophrase>lo forca</jbophrase>, and 
    <jbophrase>lo smuci</jbophrase> is the obvious candidate.</para>
    <para>The meaning of 
    <valsi>ri</valsi> must be determined every time it is used. Since 
    <valsi>ra</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ru</valsi> are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by 
    <valsi>ri</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ra</valsi>, or 
    <valsi>ru</valsi>, use 
    <valsi>goi</valsi> and a ko'a-series cmavo:</para>

    <para>Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> if it is nearby, or 
    <valsi>ta</valsi> if it is somewhat further away, or 
    <valsi>tu</valsi> if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-anaphoric-cmavo"/>.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>reference</primary><secondary>ambiguity of ti/ta/tu</secondary></indexterm> However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-QzhK">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e1d1"/>
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>ti cu barda</jbo>
        <gloss>This-one is-big.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>What is the referent of 
    <valsi>ti</valsi>? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for 
    <valsi>ti</valsi> can be plural as well as singular, and mean 
    
    <quote>these ones</quote> as well as 
    <quote>this one</quote>) the pores on the person's nose?</para>
    <para><indexterm type="general"><primary>reference</primary><secondary>use of relative clause for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clause</primary><secondary>use for reference</secondary></indexterm> To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a 
    <quote>relative clause</quote>. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator 
    <valsi>ku'o</valsi> (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, 
    <valsi>noi</valsi> is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo 
    <valsi>poi</valsi>, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.</para>

    <valsi>poi</valsi> and the 
    <valsi>ku'o</valsi> appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti 
    <valsi>ke'a</valsi> (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the 
    <quote>relativized sumti</quote>). Here are some examples before we go any further:</para>

    <valsi>poi</valsi>, and incidental (sometimes called simply 
    <quote>non-restrictive</quote>) relative clauses introduced by 
    <valsi>noi</valsi>. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in 
    <xref linkend="section-poi"/> are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)</para>
    
    
    <para>Consider the following examples:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLXK"/>, the information conveyed by 
    <jbophrase>poi blanu</jbophrase> is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> relative clauses are called restrictive. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLys"/>, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause 
    <jbophrase>noi blanu</jbophrase> just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>incidental relative clause</primary><secondary>as a parenthetical device</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>effect on relative clause in English</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clauses</primary><secondary>effect of commas in English</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clauses</primary><secondary>restricted contrasted with incidental in English expression</secondary></indexterm> In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by 
    
    
    <quote>that</quote> as well as 
    <quote>which</quote> and 
    <quote>who</quote>, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with 
    <quote>that</quote>. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> and 
    <valsi>noi</valsi> rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.</para>
    <para>Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:</para>

    <para>In this example,

    <para>In

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clause</primary><secondary>compared with tanru</secondary></indexterm> Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti 
    <jbophrase>le mi karce</jbophrase> (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-0qU1"/> means much the same as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-zsQ6"/>, which does not use a relative clause:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clause</primary><secondary>contrasted with tanru</secondary></indexterm> So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, 
    
    <jbophrase>blabi karce</jbophrase>, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-0qU1"/> can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.</para>

    <title>Relative clauses and descriptors</title>
    <para>So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.</para>
    <para>There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor ( 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, 
    <valsi>lo</valsi>, or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>), and after the 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-pcvP"/>, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:</para>
    
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-UmLX">

      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le gerku poi blabi ku'o ku cu klama vau</jbo>
        <gloss>The (dog which (is-white) ) goes.</gloss>
        <natlang>The dog which is white is going.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here 
    <valsi>ku'o</valsi> is the terminator paired with 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ku</valsi> with 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>vau</valsi> is the terminator of the whole bridi.</para>
    <para>When a simple descriptor using 
    <valsi>le</valsi>, like 
    <jbophrase>le gerku</jbophrase>, has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-UmLX"/> will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; 
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ"/>, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in 
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ"/>, the elidable terminator 
      <valsi>ku'o</valsi> must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause ( 
      <valsi>blabi</valsi>) will merge with the selbri of the description ( 
      <valsi>gerku</valsi>), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMct"/> will be apparent shortly.</para>
    <para>As is explained in detail in 
    <xref linkend="section-quantified-descriptions"/>, two different numbers (known as the 
    <quote>inner quantifier</quote> and the 
    <quote>outer quantifier</quote>) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,</para>

    <para>As the parentheses show, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDo"/> means that all five of the persons are women, whereas 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ"/> means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ"/>, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>, or if the relative clause comes before an explicit 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>, then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.</para>
    <para>What about 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMdb"/>? By convention, it means the same as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ"/>, and it requires no 
    <valsi>ku</valsi>, but it does typically require a 
    <valsi>ku'o</valsi> instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.</para>
    <para>When 
    <valsi>le</valsi> is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be 
    <valsi>ro</valsi> (meaning 
    <quote>all</quote>), as is explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-quantified-descriptions"/>. Thus 
    <jbophrase>le gerku</jbophrase> is taken to mean 
    <quote>all of the things I refer to as dogs</quote>, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the 
    <valsi>ku</valsi> or before it. However, if the descriptor is

    <para>Both 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDS"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmdX"/> tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does 
    <jbophrase>lo prenu noi blabi</jbophrase> mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is 
    <valsi>ro</valsi> (meaning 
    <quote>all</quote>), and the default outer quantifier is 
    <valsi>su'o</valsi> (meaning 
    <quote>at least one</quote>). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.</para>
    
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDS"/>, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmdX"/>, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning 
    <quote>First take all persons &ndash; by the way, they're all white</quote>. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clauses on lo</primary><secondary>syntax suggestion</secondary></indexterm> The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use 
    <valsi>ku</valsi> when attaching a 
    <valsi>noi</valsi> relative clause to a 
    <valsi>lo</valsi> descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-4sqi"/> is a bit complex, and may need some picking apart. The quotation

    <quote>The Red Pony</quote>. If the

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-4sqi"/> would claim that a certain string of words is in a room distant from the speaker. But obviously a string of words can't be in a room! The effect of the 
    <valsi>la'e</valsi> is to modify the sumti so that it refers not to the words themselves, but to the referent of those words, a novel by John Steinbeck (presumably in Lojban translation). The particular copy of 
    <quote>The Red Pony</quote> is identified by the restrictive relative clause. 
    
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-4sqi"/> means exactly the same as:</para>

    <para>and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants. Note the required

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>relative clauses on complex sumti</primary><secondary>Lojban contrasted with English</secondary></indexterm> English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the case of

The objects are expressed by Lojban grammatical forms called 
    <valsi>sumti</valsi>; the relationship is expressed by the Lojban grammatical form called a 
    <valsi>selbri</valsi>.</para>

    <quote>place structure</quote> of the selbri. This chapter describes the various ways in which the place structure of Lojban bridi is expressed and by which it can be manipulated. The place structure of a selbri is a sequence of empty slots into which the sumti associated with that selbri are placed. The sumti are said to occupy the places of the selbri.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>place structure of selbri</primary><secondary>determining</secondary></indexterm> For our present purposes, every selbri is assumed to have a well-known place structure. If the selbri is a brivla, the place structure can be looked up in a dictionary (or, if the brivla is a lujvo not in any dictionary, inferred from the principles of lujvo construction as explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-lujvo"/>); if the selbri is a tanru, the place structure is the same as that of the final component in the tanru.</para>

    <para>The

The work done so far has attempted to establish a basic place structure on which all users can, at first, agree. In the light of actual experience with the individual selbri of the language, there will inevitably be some degree of change to the brivla place structures.</para>

    <valsi>cu</valsi> (belonging to selma'o CU) is used to separate the selbri from any preceding sumti. It is never absolutely necessary to use 
    <valsi>cu</valsi>. However, providing it helps the reader or listener to locate the selbri quickly, and may make it possible to place a complex sumti just before the selbri, allowing the speaker to omit elidable terminators, possibly a whole stream of them, that would otherwise be necessary.</para>

    <xref linkend="chapter-connectives"/>), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped.

    <para>The place structure of

    <jbophrase>poi se cusku</jbophrase> uses the cmavo

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>tense</primary><secondary>explanation of presentation method</secondary></indexterm> This chapter attempts to document and explain the space/time tense system of Lojban. It does not attempt to answer all questions of the form 
    
    <quote>How do I say such-and-such (an English tense) in Lojban?</quote> Instead, it explores the Lojban tense system from the inside, attempting to educate the reader into a Lojbanic viewpoint. Once the overall system is understood and the resources that it makes available are familiar, the reader should have some hope of using appropriate tense constructs and being correctly understood.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>tense</primary><secondary>Lojban contrasted with native languages</secondary></indexterm> The system of Lojban tenses presented here may seem really complex because of all the pieces and all the options; indeed, this chapter is the longest one in this book. But tense is in fact complex in every language. In your native language, the subtleties of tense are intuitive. In foreign languages, you are seldom taught the entire system until you have reached an advanced level. Lojban tenses are extremely systematic and productive, allowing you to express subtleties based on what they mean rather than on how they act similarly to English tenses. This chapter concentrates on presenting an intuitive approach to the meaning of Lojban tense words and how they may be creatively and productively combined.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>temporal tense</primary><secondary>Lojban contrasted with English in necessity</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>temporal tense</primary><secondary>as mandatory in English</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>temporal tense</primary><secondary>real relationship to time in English</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>temporal tense</primary><secondary>historical definition</secondary></indexterm> What is 
    <quote>tense</quote>? Historically, 
    <quote>tense</quote> is the attribute of verbs in English and related languages that expresses the time of the action. In English, three tenses are traditionally recognized, conventionally called the past, the present, and the future. There are also a variety of compound tenses used in English. However, there is no simple relationship between the form of an English tense and the time actually expressed:</para>
    <!-- FIXME: should these be in an <example>? if so, will any random id work? -->
    <para>I go to London tomorrow.</para>

    <para>I will go to London tomorrow.</para>

    <para>I am going to London tomorrow.</para>
    <para>all mean the same thing, even though the first sentence uses the present tense; the second, the future tense; and the third, a compound tense usually called 
    
    
    
    <quote>present progressive</quote>. Likewise, a newspaper headline says 
    <quote>JONES DIES</quote>, although it is obvious that the time referred to must be in the past. Tense is a mandatory category of English: every sentence must be marked for tense, even if in a way contrary to logic, because every main verb has a tense marker built into to it. By contrast, Lojban brivla have no implicit tense marker attached to them.</para>

In addition, tense structures provide information about location in space as well as in time. All tense information is optional in Lojban: a sentence like:</para>

          <gloss>I go-to the market.</gloss>
        </interlinear-gloss>
      </example>
      <para> can be understood as:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>I went to the market.</member>
        <member>I am going to the market.</member>
        <member>I have gone to the market.</member>
        <member>I will go to the market.</member>
        <member>I continually go to the market.</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>as well as many other possibilities: context resolves which is correct.</para>

      <valsi>cu</valsi>, and can in fact always replace the 
      <valsi>cu</valsi> (although in very complex sentences the rules for eliding terminators may be changed as a result). In the following examples, 
      <valsi>pu</valsi> is the tense marker for

      <valsi>pu</valsi> for the past, 
      <valsi>ca</valsi> for the present, and 
      <valsi>ba</valsi> for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the corresponding gismu

      <valsi>balvi</valsi>. See 
      <xref linkend="section-tenses-vs-modals"/> for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.) There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute and relative directions as well as

We have a sense of 
      
      <quote>now</quote> which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future, and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the 
      <quote>zero direction</quote>, Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction: 
      <valsi>bu'u</valsi>, which means something like

      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qDu0"/> and

      <valsi>zi</valsi> by itself signals an event that happens at a time close to the present, but without saying whether it is in the past or the future. A rough translation might be

    <para> 
      Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of events happening in an unspecified space direction ( 
      <quote>nearby</quote> or 
      <quote>far away</quote>), but we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens 
      <quote>nearby in time</quote> is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.</para>

      <xref linkend="example-random-id-naft"/> points up a fundamental difference between Lojban tenses and English tenses. An English past-tense sentence like 
      <quote>I went to the market</quote> generally signifies that the going-to-the-market is entirely in the past; that is, that the event is complete at the time of speaking. Lojban

      <para>This general principle does not mean that Lojban has no way of indicating that a tree will be green but is not yet green. Indeed, there are several ways of expressing that concept: see

One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify that a motion 
      <quote>in a small space</quote> is more specifically

(Readers who don't wish to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called 
      
      
      <valsi>vi'a</valsi>, because relatively speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface. Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a single mountain) would be properly described with 
      
      <valsi>vi'u</valsi>. So the cognitive, rather than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.</para>

      <valsi>vi'e</valsi> which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time considered as an Einsteinian whole. (There are presently no cmavo of FAhA assigned to 
      
      
      
      <quote>pastward</quote> and 
      
      <quote>futureward</quote> considered as space rather than time directions &ndash; they could be added, though, if Lojbanists find space-time expression useful.) If a temporal tense cmavo is used in the same tense construct with a 
      
      
      <valsi>vi'e</valsi> interval, the resulting tense may be self-contradictory.</para>

Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO afterward.

    <valsi>fe'e</valsi>) are also useful as sumti tcita. The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from that of FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the sumti is viewed as a process, and the action of the main bridi occurs at the phase of the process which the ZAhO specifies, or at least some part of that phase. The action of the main bridi itself is seen as a point event, so that there is no issue about which phase of the main bridi is intended. For example:</para>

    <quote>stickiness</quote>: the tense gets 
    <quote>stuck</quote> and remains in effect until explicitly 
    <quote>unstuck</quote>. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood.

    <para>

    <para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>story time</primary><secondary>with no initial sticky time</secondary></indexterm> If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and making it sticky.

    <title>Tenses in subordinate bridi</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>subordinate clauses</primary><secondary>tense usage rules in English</secondary></indexterm> English has a set of rules, formally known as 
    <quote>sequence of tense rules</quote>, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:</para>

        <para>John said that George had gone to the market.</para>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qECX"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qeds"/>, the tense of the main sentence is the present: 
    <quote>says</quote>. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense 
    <quote>is going</quote> ( 
    <quote>goes</quote> would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense 
    <quote>went</quote>. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with 
    <quote>said</quote>, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense 
    <quote>went</quote>; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense 
    <quote>had gone</quote>.</para>
    <para>The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qECX"/> through

    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti-tcita"/>. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.</para>

    <title>Explicit magnitudes</title>
    <para>It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes: small, medium, or large. In order to express both an origin point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction called a 
    <quote>termset</quote> is employed. (Termsets are explained further in 
    <xref linkend="section-termsets"/> and 
    <xref linkend="section-quantifier-grouping"/>.) It is grammatical for a termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey and its distance to be specified. Here is an example:</para>

    <para>Here the termset extends from the

    <jbophrase>la djordj.</jbophrase>, which is the unmarked origin point, and the tagged sumti 
    <jbophrase>lo mitre be li mu</jbophrase>, which the cmavo 
    <valsi>la'u</valsi> (of selma'o BAI, and meaning 
    <quote>with quantity</quote>; see

    <title>The syntax of abstraction</title>
    <para>The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as 
    <quote>abstraction</quote> is to provide a means for taking whole bridi and packaging them up, as it were, into simple selbri. Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform; semantically, they are rich and complex, with few features in common between one variety of abstraction and another. We will begin by discussing syntax without regard to semantics; as a result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at first. Bear with this difficulty until 
    <xref linkend="section-events"/>.</para>
    <para> An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and preceding it by any cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such cmavo; they are known as 
    <quote>abstractors</quote>. The bridi is closed by the elidable terminator 
    <valsi>kei</valsi>, of selma'o KEI. Thus, to change the bridi</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>KEI selma'o</primary><secondary>eliding</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>observatives</primary><secondary>and abstractions</secondary></indexterm> The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated sumti, as here. It is important to beware of eliding 
    <valsi>kei</valsi> improperly, as many of the common uses of abstraction selbri involve following them with words that would appear to be part of the abstraction if 
    <valsi>kei</valsi> had been elided.</para>
    <para>(Technically, 
    <valsi>kei</valsi> is never necessary, because the elidable terminator 
    <valsi>vau</valsi> that closes every bridi can substitute for it; however, 
    <valsi>kei</valsi> is specific to abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)</para>

In particular, abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Via0"/>, or used in tanru:</para>

    <para>

        <gloss>John desires the event-of being-a-soldier.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction either at the end of a bridi, or just before the main selbri with its 
    <valsi>cu</valsi>; in either of these circumstances, 
    <valsi>kei</valsi> can normally be elided.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>abstractions</primary><secondary>place structure</secondary></indexterm> The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the particular abstractor, and will be explained individually in the following sections.</para>
    <para>Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the grammatical form used in the English changes. Thus, in the gloss of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Via0"/> we see 
    <quote>my going-to the store</quote> rather than 
    <quote>I go-to the store</quote>; likewise, in the glosses of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-0Ff4"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-sQ33"/> we see 
    <quote>being-a-soldier</quote> rather than 
    <quote>is-a-soldier</quote>. This procedure reflects the desire for more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change in the Lojban form. A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change when it is used as part of an abstraction selbri.</para>

Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for 
    
    <valsi>nu</valsi> abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:</para>

The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is 
    <valsi>tu'a</valsi>, which belongs to selma'o LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>intermediate abstraction</primary></indexterm> The term 
    <quote>sumti-raising</quote>, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is 
    
    <quote>raised</quote> to the main bridi level. This transformation from 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-1WER"/> to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gabC"/> loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.</para>
    <para>Using 
    <valsi>tu'a</valsi> is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:</para>

    <jbophrase>tu'a le vorme</jbophrase> cannot be understood. (The terminator for 
    <valsi>tu'a</valsi> is 
    <valsi>lu'u</valsi>, and is used in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-mKBy"/> to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word 
    <valsi>vorme</valsi> as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:</para>

        <gloss>something-to-do-with John frequently-occurs</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the 
    <valsi>tu'a</valsi>, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-9S5B"/> would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs &ndash; in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of 
    <valsi>cafne</valsi> is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that 
    <cmevla>djan.</cmevla> is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>abstractions</primary><secondary>simplification to sumti with jai</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>abstractions</primary><secondary>making concrete</secondary></indexterm> Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to 
    <valsi>tu'a</valsi> which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo 
    <valsi>jai</valsi> (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-modal-jai"/> and 
    <xref linkend="section-jai"/>; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-jAdY"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-R8SN"/> look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions,

    <para>The weakness of

    <title>Why have lujvo?</title>
    <para>The Lojban vocabulary is founded on its list of 1350-plus gismu, made up by combining word lists from various sources. These gismu are not intended to be either a complete vocabulary for the language nor a minimal list of semantic primitives. Instead, the gismu list serves as a basis for the creation of compound words, or lujvo. The intention is that (except in certain semantically broad but shallow fields such as cultures, nations, foods, plants, and animals) suitable lujvo can be devised to cover the ten million or so concepts expressible in all the world's languages taken together. Grammatically, lujvo behave just like gismu: they have place structures and function as selbri.</para>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>compared with tanru</secondary></indexterm> There is a close relationship between lujvo and tanru. In fact, lujvo are condensed forms of tanru:</para>

        <gloss>That is-fire waste.</gloss>

    </example>
    <para>contains a tanru which can be reduced to the lujvo in:</para>

        <gloss>That is-fire-waste.</gloss>
        <gloss>That is-ashes.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Although the lujvo 
    <valsi>fagyfesti</valsi> is derived from the tanru 
    <jbophrase>fagri festi</jbophrase>, it is not equivalent in meaning to it. In particular, 
    <valsi>fagyfesti</valsi> has a distinct place structure of its own, not the same as that of 
    <valsi>festi</valsi>. (In contrast, the tanru does have the same place structure as 
    <valsi>festi</valsi>.) The lujvo needs to take account of the places of 
    <valsi>fagri</valsi> as well. When a tanru is made into a lujvo, there is no equivalent of 
    <valsi>be</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>bei</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>be'o</valsi> (described in 
    <xref linkend="section-be-sumti"/>) to incorporate sumti into the middle of the lujvo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>rationale for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>creative understanding</primary></indexterm> So why have lujvo? Primarily to reduce semantic ambiguity. On hearing a tanru, there is a burden on the listener to figure out what the tanru might mean. Adding further terms to the tanru reduces ambiguity in one sense, by providing more information; but it increases ambiguity in another sense, because there are more and more tanru joints, each with an ambiguous significance. Since lujvo, like other brivla, have a fixed place structure and a single meaning, encapsulating a commonly-used tanru into a lujvo relieves the listener of the burden of creative understanding. In addition, lujvo are typically shorter than the corresponding tanru.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>guidelines</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>guidelines for place structure</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>absolute laws</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>alternative guidelines</primary></indexterm> There are no absolute laws fixing the place structure of a newly created lujvo. The maker must consider the place structures of all the components of the tanru and then decide which are still relevant and which can be removed. What is said in this chapter represents guidelines, presented as one possible standard, not necessarily complete, and not the only possible standard. There may well be lujvo that are built without regard for these guidelines, or in accordance with entirely different guidelines, should such alternative guidelines someday be developed. The reason for presenting any guidelines at all is so that Lojbanists have a starting point for deciding on a likely place structure &ndash; one that others seeing the same word can also arrive at by similar consideration.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>cmavo incorporation</secondary></indexterm> If the tanru includes connective cmavo such as 
    <valsi>bo</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi>, or 
    <valsi>je</valsi>, or conversion or abstraction cmavo such as 
    <valsi>se</valsi> or 
    <valsi>nu</valsi>, there are ways of incorporating them into the lujvo as well. Sometimes this makes the lujvo excessively long; if so, the cmavo may be dropped. This leads to the possibility that more than one tanru could produce the same lujvo. Typically, however, only one of the possible tanru is useful enough to justify making a lujvo for it.</para>
    <para>The exact workings of the lujvo-making algorithm, which takes a tanru built from gismu (and possibly cmavo) and produces a lujvo from it, are described in 
    <xref linkend="section-lujvo-making"/>.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-tanru-meanings">
    <title>The meaning of tanru: a necessary detour</title>
    
    <para>The meaning of a lujvo is controlled by &ndash; but is not the same as &ndash; the meaning of the tanru from which the lujvo was constructed. The tanru corresponding to a lujvo is called its 
    <valsi>veljvo</valsi> in Lojban, and since there is no concise English equivalent, that term will be used in this chapter. Furthermore, the left (modifier) part of a tanru will be called the 
    <valsi>seltau</valsi>, and the right (modified) part the 
    <valsi>tertau</valsi>, following the usage of 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/>. For brevity, we will speak of the seltau or tertau of a lujvo, meaning of course the seltau or tertau of the veljvo of that lujvo. (If this terminology is confusing, substituting 
    <quote>modifier</quote> for 
    <valsi>seltau</valsi> and 
    <quote>modified</quote> for 
    <valsi>tertau</valsi> may help.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>place structure of</secondary></indexterm> The place structure of a tanru is always the same as the place structure of its tertau. As a result, the meaning of the tanru is a modified version of the meaning of the tertau; the tanru will typically, but not always, refer to a subset of the things referred to by the tertau.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>purpose</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>wine-dark sea</primary></indexterm> The purpose of a tanru is to join concepts together without necessarily focusing on the exact meaning of the seltau. For example, in the 
    <citetitle>Iliad</citetitle>, the poet talks about 
    <quote>the wine-dark sea</quote>, in which 
    
    <quote>wine</quote> is a seltau relative to 
    <quote>dark</quote>, and the pair of words is a seltau relative to 
    <quote>sea</quote>. We're talking about the sea, not about wine or color. The other words are there to paint a scene in the listener's mind, in which the real action will occur, and to evoke relations to other sagas of the time similarly describing the sea. Logical inferences about wine or color will be rejected as irrelevant.</para>
    
    <para> 

<indexterm type="general"><primary>goer-house</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

 As a simple example, consider the rather non-obvious tanru 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase>, or 
    <quote>goer-house</quote>. The gismu 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> has two places:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-xcfi">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e2d1"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>x1 is a nest/house/lair/den for inhabitant x2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>(but in this chapter we will use simply 
    <quote>house</quote>, for brevity), and the gismu 
    <valsi>klama</valsi> has five:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-zUVg">

      </title>
      <para><definition><content>x1 goes to destination x2 from origin point x3 via route x4 using means x5</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>The tanru 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase> will also have two places, namely those of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. Since a 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase> is a type of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, we can assume that all goer-houses &ndash; whatever they may be &ndash; are also houses.</para>
    <para> 

<indexterm type="general"><primary>dog house</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>possible meanings of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>fleas</primary></indexterm> But is knowing the places of the tertau everything that is needed to understand the meaning of a tanru? No. To see why, let us switch to a less unlikely tanru: 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, literally 
    <quote>dog house</quote>. A tanru expresses a very loose relation: a 
    
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> is a house that has something to do with some dog or dogs. What the precise relation might be is left unstated. Thus, the meaning of 
    <jbophrase>lo gerku zdani</jbophrase> can include all of the following: houses occupied by dogs, houses shaped by dogs, dogs which are also houses (e.g. houses for fleas), houses named after dogs, and so on. All that is essential is that the place structure of 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> continues to apply.</para>
    
    <para>For something (call it z1) to qualify as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> in Lojban, it's got to be a house, first of all. For it to be a house, it's got to house someone (call that z2). Furthermore, there's got to be a dog somewhere (called g1). For g1 to count as a dog in Lojban, it's got to belong to some breed as well (called g2). And finally, for z1 to be in the first place of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, as opposed to just 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, there's got to be some relationship (called r) between some place of 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> and some place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>. It doesn't matter which places, because if there's a relationship between some place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> and any place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>, then that relationship can be compounded with the relationship between the places of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>- namely, 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> itself &ndash; to reach any of the other 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> places. Thus, if the relationship turns out to be between z2 and g2, we can still state r in terms of z1 and g1: 
    <quote>the relationship involves the dog g1, whose breed has to do with the occupant of the house z1</quote>.</para>
    <para> 


 Doubtless to the relief of the reader, here's an illustration. We want to find out whether the White House (the one in which the U. S. President lives, that is) counts as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>. We go through the five variables. The White House is the z1. It houses Bill Clinton as z2, as of this writing, so it counts as a 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. Let's take a dog &ndash; say, Spot (g1). Spot has to have a breed; let's say it's a Saint Bernard (g2). Now, the White House counts as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> if there is any relationship (r) at all between the White House and Spot. (We'll choose the g1 and z1 places to relate by r; we could have chosen any other pair of places, and simply gotten a different relationship.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Chelsea Clinton</primary></indexterm> The sky is the limit for r; it can be as complicated as 
    <quote>The other day, g1 (Spot) chased Socks, who is owned by Chelsea Clinton, who is the daughter of Bill Clinton, who lives in z1 (the White House)</quote> or even worse. If no such r can be found, well, you take another dog, and keep going until no more dogs can be found. Only then can we say that the White House cannot fit into the first place of 
    
    
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para>As we have seen, no less than five elements are involved in the definition of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>: the house, the house dweller, the dog, the dog breed (everywhere a dog goes in Lojban, a dog breed follows), and the relationship between the house and the dog. Since tanru are explicitly ambiguous in Lojban, the relationship r cannot be expressed within a tanru (if it could, it wouldn't be a tanru any more!) All the other places, however, can be expressed &ndash; thus:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>derogatory terms</primary></indexterm> Not the most elegant sentence ever written in either Lojban or English. Yet if there is any relation at all between Spot and the White House, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-tUDa"/> is arguably true. If we concentrate on just one type of relation in interpreting the tanru 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, then the meaning of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> changes. So if we understand 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> as having the same meaning as the English word 
    <quote>doghouse</quote>, the White House would no longer be a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> with respect to Spot, because as far as we know Spot does not actually live in the White House, and the White House is not a doghouse (derogatory terms for incumbents notwithstanding).</para>
    
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-lujvo-meanings">
    <title>The meaning of lujvo</title>
    <para>This is a fairly long way to go to try and work out how to say 
    <quote>doghouse</quote>! The reader can take heart; we're nearly there. Recall that one of the components involved in fixing the meaning of a tanru &ndash; the one left deliberately vague &ndash; is the precise relation between the tertau and the seltau. Indeed, fixing this relation is tantamount to giving an interpretation to the ambiguous tanru.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>and seltau/tertau relationship</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>interpreting</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>disambiguated instance</primary></indexterm> A lujvo is defined by a single disambiguated instance of a tanru. That is to say, when we try to design the place structure of a lujvo, we don't need to try to discover the relation between the tertau and the seltau. We already know what kind of relation we're looking for; it's given by the specific need we wish to express, and it determines the place structure of the lujvo itself.</para>
    
    <para>Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to simply devise lujvo and decide on place structures for them without considering one or more specific usages for the coinage. If one does not consider specifics, one will be likely to make erroneous generalizations on the relationship r.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>design consideration for relationship</secondary></indexterm> The insight driving the rest of this chapter is this: while the relation expressed by a tanru can be very distant (e.g. Spot chasing Socks, above), the relationship singled out for disambiguation in a lujvo should be quite close. This is because lujvo-making, paralleling natural language compounding, picks out the most salient relationship r between a tertau place and a seltau place to be expressed in a single word. The relationship 
    <quote>dog chases cat owned by daughter of person living in house</quote> is too distant, and too incidental, to be likely to need expression as a single short word; the relationship 
    <quote>dog lives in house</quote> is not. From all the various interpretations of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, the person creating 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> should pick the most useful value of r. The most useful one is usually going to be the most obvious one, and the most obvious one is usually the closest one.</para>
    <para>In fact, the relationship will almost always be so close that the predicate expressing r will be either the seltau or the tertau predicate itself. This should come as no surprise, given that a word like 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> in Lojban is a predicate. Predicates express relations; so when you're looking for a relation to tie together 
    <jbophrase>le zdani</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>le gerku</jbophrase>, the most obvious relation to pick is the very relation named by the tertau, 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>: the relation between a home and its dweller. As a result, the object which fills the first place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> (the dog) also fills the second place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> (the house-dweller).</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>dropping redundant places</secondary></indexterm> The seltau-tertau relationship in the veljvo is expressed by the seltau or tertau predicate itself. Therefore, at least one of the seltau places is going to be equivalent to a tertau place. This place is thus redundant, and can be dropped from the place structure of the lujvo. As a corollary, the precise relationship between the veljvo components can be implicitly determined by finding one or more places to overlap in this way.</para>
    <para>So what is the place structure of 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi>? We're left with three places, since the dweller, the 
    <jbophrase>se zdani</jbophrase>, turned out to be identical to the dog, the

    <xref linkend="section-tanru-meanings"/> will be useful in the rest of this chapter. Rather than using the regular x1, x2, etc. to represent places, we'll use the first letter of the relevant gismu in place of the 
    <quote>x</quote>, or more than one letter where necessary to resolve ambiguities. Thus, z1 is the first place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, and g2 is the second place of

    <para>Despite the apparently conclusive nature of

These concerns will be addressed in the remainder of the chapter; but we are now equipped with the terminology needed for those discussions.</para>

  <section xml:id="section-selecting-places">
    <title>Selecting places</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>basis of</secondary></indexterm> The set of places of an ordinary lujvo are selected from the places of its component gismu. More precisely, the places of such a lujvo are derived from the set of places of the component gismu by eliminating unnecessary places, until just enough places remain to give an appropriate meaning to the lujvo. In general, including a place makes the concept expressed by a lujvo more general; excluding a place makes the concept more specific, because omitting the place requires assuming a standard value or range of values for it.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>rationale for standardization</secondary></indexterm> It would be possible to design the place structure of a lujvo from scratch, treating it as if it were a gismu, and working out what arguments contribute to the notion to be expressed by the lujvo. There are two reasons arguing against doing so and in favor of the procedure detailed in this chapter.</para>
    <para>The first is that it might be very difficult for a hearer or reader, who has no preconceived idea of what concept the lujvo is intended to convey, to work out what the place structure actually is. Instead, he or she would have to make use of a lujvo dictionary every time a lujvo is encountered in order to work out what a 
    <jbophrase>se jbopli</jbophrase> or a 
    <jbophrase>te klagau</jbophrase> is. But this would mean that, rather than having to learn just the 1300-odd gismu place structures, a Lojbanist would also have to learn myriads of lujvo place structures with little or no apparent pattern or regularity to them. The purpose of the guidelines documented in this chapter is to apply regularity and to make it conventional wherever possible.</para>
    <para>The second reason is related to the first: if the veljvo of the lujvo has not been properly selected, and the places for the lujvo are formulated from scratch, then there is a risk that some of the places formulated may not correspond to any of the places of the gismu used in the veljvo of the lujvo. If that is the case &ndash; that is to say, if the lujvo places are not a subset of the veljvo gismu places &ndash; then it will be very difficult for the hearer or reader to understand what a particular place means, and what it is doing in that particular lujvo. This is a topic that will be further discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-anomalous-lujvo"/>.</para>
    <para>However, second-guessing the place structure of the lujvo is useful in guiding the process of subsequently eliminating places from the veljvo. If the Lojbanist has an idea of what the final place structure should look like, he or she should be able to pick an appropriate veljvo to begin with, in order to express the idea, and then to decide which places are relevant or not relevant to expressing that idea.</para>

    <title>Dependent places</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>dependent places</secondary></indexterm> In order to understand which places, if any, should be completely removed from a lujvo place structure, we need to understand the concept of dependent places. One place of a brivla is said to be dependent on another if its value can be predicted from the values of one or more of the other places. For example, the g2 place of 
    
    
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> is dependent on the g1 place. Why? Because when we know what fits in the g1 place (Spot, let us say, a well-known dog), then we know what fits in the g2 place ( 
    <quote>St. Bernard</quote>, let us say). In other words, when the value of the g1 place has been specified, the value of the g2 place is determined by it. Conversely, since each dog has only one breed, but each breed contains many dogs, the g1 place is not dependent on the g2 place; if we know only that some dog is a St. Bernard, we cannot tell by that fact alone which dog is meant.</para>
    <para>For 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, on the other hand, there is no dependency between the places. When we know the identity of a house-dweller, we have not determined the house, because a dweller may dwell in more than one house. By the same token, when we know the identity of a house, we do not know the identity of its dweller, for a house may contain more than one dweller.</para>

Different place structures imply different concepts, and the lujvo maker may be trying to shoehorn the wrong concept into the place structure of his or her choosing. This is obvious when someone tries to shoehorn a 
    
    
    <valsi>klama</valsi> tertau into a 
    <valsi>litru</valsi> or 
    <valsi>cliva</valsi> concept, for example: these gismu differ in their number of arguments, and suppressing places of 
    <valsi>klama</valsi> in a lujvo doesn't make any sense if the resulting modified place structure is that of 
    <valsi>litru</valsi> or 
    <valsi>cliva</valsi>.</para>
    <para>Sometimes the dependency is between a single place of the tertau and the whole event described by the seltau. Such cases are discussed further in

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place order</primary></indexterm> So far, we have concentrated on selecting the places to go into the place structure of a lujvo. However, this is only half the story. In using selbri in Lojban, it is important to remember the right order of the sumti.

People need consistent patterns to make sense of what they learn. Such patterns can be found across gismu place structures (see 
    <xref linkend="section-gismu-place-structures"/>), and are even more necessary in lujvo place structures. Case-by-case consideration is still necessary; lujvo creation is a subtle art, after all. But it is helpful to take advantage of any available regularities.</para>

    <para> 


  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo place order</primary><secondary>based on 3-or-more part veljvo</secondary></indexterm> The theory we have outlined so far is an account of lujvo with two parts. But often lujvo are made containing more than two parts. An example is 
    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi>, 
    <quote>tomorrow</quote>: it is composed of the rafsi for 
    
    <quote>future</quote>, 
    <quote>adjacent</quote>, and 
    <quote>day</quote>. How does the account we have given apply to lujvo like this?</para>
    <para>The best way to approach such lujvo is to continue to classify them as based on binary tanru, the only difference being that the seltau or the tertau or both is itself a lujvo. So it is easiest to make sense of 
    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi> as having two components: 
    <valsi>bavla'i</valsi>, 
    <quote>next</quote>, and 
    <valsi>djedi</valsi>. If we know or invent the lujvo place structure for the components, we can compose the new lujvo place structure in the usual way.</para>
    
    
    <para>In this case,

    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi>. This is an example of how the guidelines presented for selecting and ordering lujvo places are just that, not laws that must be rigidly adhered to. In this case, we choose to rank places in order of relative importance. The resulting place structure is:</para>

    <valsi>cladakyxa'i</valsi>, meaning

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sword blade</primary></indexterm> Since

    <jbophrase>cladakfu xarci</jbophrase>, and 
    <valsi>cladakfu</valsi> is itself a symmetrical lujvo, we can do the necessary analyses all at once. Plainly c1 (the long thing), d1 (the knife), and xa1 (the weapon) are all the same. Likewise, the d2 place (the thing cut) is the same as the xa2 place (the target of the weapon), given that swords are used to cut victims. Finally, the c2 place (direction of length) is always along the sword blade in a longsword, by definition, and so is dependent on c1=d1=xa1. Adding on the places of the remaining gismu in right-to-left order we get:</para>

    </example>
    <para>If the last place sounds unimportant to you, notice that what counts legally as a 
    <quote>sword</quote>, rather than just a 
    <quote>knife</quote>, depends on the length of the blade (the legal limit varies in different jurisdictions). This fifth place of 
    <valsi>cladakyxa'i</valsi> may not often be explicitly filled, but it is still useful on occasion. Because it is so seldom important, it is best that it be last.</para>

But should the lujvo get to the stage where a place structure needs to be worked out, then the precise relation does need to be specified. And in that case, such abbreviated lujvo form a trap in lujvo place ordering, since they obscure the most straightforward relation between the seltau and tertau.

    <valsi>se</valsi> that really should be there), any attempt to accommodate the resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place structure is fitting a square peg in a round hole.

    <rafsi>sel-</rafsi> (from

    <rafsi>nal-</rafsi> (from

    <valsi>to'e</valsi>): the scope of the rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>ke'e</valsi> group. For that reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting 
    <valsi>se</valsi>, 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> or 
    <valsi>to'e</valsi> before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>, than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.</para>
    <para>It is all right to replace the phrase 
    <jbophrase>se klama</jbophrase> with 
    <valsi>selkla</valsi>, and the places of 
    <valsi>selkla</valsi> are exactly those of 
    <jbophrase>se klama</jbophrase>. But consider the related lujvo 
    <valsi>dzukla</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>to walk to somewhere</quote>. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo 
    <jbophrase>cadzu klama</jbophrase> as follows:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-4yG0">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e11d7"/>
      </title>

      <para><valsi>dzukla</valsi>: c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2</para>
    </example>
    <para>We can swap the k1 and k2 places using 
    <jbophrase>se dzukla</jbophrase>, but we cannot directly make 
    <jbophrase>se dzukla</jbophrase> into 
    <valsi>seldzukla</valsi>, which would represent the veljvo 
    <jbophrase>selcadzu klama</jbophrase> and plausibly mean something like 
    <quote>to go to a walking surface</quote>. Instead, we would need 
    <valsi>selkemdzukla</valsi>, with an explicit rafsi for 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>. Similarly, 
    <valsi>nalbrablo</valsi> (from 
    <jbophrase>na'e barda bloti</jbophrase>) means 
    <quote>non-big boat</quote>, whereas 
    
    <jbophrase>na'e brablo</jbophrase> means 
    <quote>other than a big boat</quote>.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo creation</primary><secondary>use of multiple SE in</secondary></indexterm> If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, 
    <valsi>gekmau</valsi> means 
    <quote>happier than</quote>, while 
    <valsi>selgekmau</valsi> means 
    <quote>making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than</quote>. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is 
    <jbophrase>se selgekmau</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para>But we can also say it is 
    <valsi>selselgekmau</valsi>. Two 
    <valsi>se</valsi> cmavo in a row cancel each other ( 
    <jbophrase>se se gleki</jbophrase> means the same as just 
    <valsi>gleki</valsi>), so there would be no good reason to have 
    <jbophrase>selsel</jbophrase> in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret 
    <jbophrase>selsel-</jbophrase> as 
    <jbophrase>selkemsel-</jbophrase>. The rafsi combinations 
    <jbophrase>terter-</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>velvel-</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>xelxel-</jbophrase> work in the same way.</para>
    <para>Other SE combinations like 
    <jbophrase>selter-</jbophrase>, although they might conceivably mean 
    <jbophrase>se te</jbophrase>, more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as 
    
    <jbophrase>se ke te</jbophrase>, since there is no need to re-order places in the way that 
    <jbophrase>se te</jbophrase> provides. (See

    <jbophrase>nunkalri gasnu</jbophrase> means much the same as

    <para>Eliding NU rafsi involves the same restrictions as eliding SE rafsi, plus additional ones.

However, they may be elided from the seltau if no reasonable ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>A major difference, however, between SE elision and NU elision is that the former is a rather sparse process, providing a few convenient shortenings. Eliding

    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> is 
    <jbophrase>nu citka kei gasnu</jbophrase>. The relevant place structures are:</para>

        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d1"/>

      <para>
      <valsi>gasnu</valsi>: g1 does action/is the agent of event g2</para>
    </example>
    <para>In accordance with the procedure for analyzing three-part lujvo given in 
    <xref linkend="section-n-part-lujvo"/>, we will first create an intermediate lujvo, 
    <valsi>nuncti</valsi>, whose veljvo is 
    <jbophrase>nu citka [kei]</jbophrase>. By the rules given in 
    <xref linkend="section-abstraction-lujvo"/>, 
    <valsi>nuncti</valsi> has the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Xhrx">
      <title>

      </title>
      <para><definition><content>n1 is the event of c1 eating c2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>Now we can transform the veljvo of 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> into 
    <jbophrase>nuncti gasnu</jbophrase>. The g2 place (what is brought about by the actor g1) obviously denotes the same thing as n1 (the event of eating). So we can eliminate g2 as redundant, leaving us with a tentative place structure of</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-izvp">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d3"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>g1 is the actor in the event n1=g2 of c1 eating c2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>But it is also possible to omit the n1 place itself! The n1 place describes the event brought about; an event in Lojban is described as a bridi, by a selbri and its sumti; the selbri is already known (it's the seltau), and the sumti are also already known (they're in the lujvo place structure). So n1 would not give us any information we didn't already know. In fact, the n1=g2 place is dependent on c1 and c2 jointly &ndash; it does not depend on either c1 or c2 by itself. Being dependent and derived from the seltau, it is omissible. So the final place structure of 
    
    
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> is:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-9oTP">
      <title>

      </title>
      <para><definition><content>g1 is the actor in the event of c1 eating c2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>There is one further step that can be taken. As we have already seen with 
    <valsi>balsoi</valsi> in 
    <xref linkend="section-symmetrical-asymmetrical"/>, the interpretation of lujvo is constrained by the semantics of gismu and of their sumti places. Now, any asymmetrical lujvo with 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> as its tertau will involve an event abstraction either implicitly or explicitly, since that is how the g2 place of 
    
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> is defined.</para>
    <para>Therefore, if we assume that 
    <valsi>nu</valsi> is the type of abstraction one would expect to be a 
    <jbophrase>se gasnu</jbophrase>, then the rafsi 
    <rafsi>nun</rafsi> and 
    <rafsi>kez</rafsi> in 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> are only telling us what we would already have guessed &ndash; that the seltau of a 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> lujvo is an event. If we drop these rafsi out, and use instead the shorter lujvo 
    <valsi>ctigau</valsi>, rejecting its symmetrical interpretation ( 
    <quote>someone who both does and eats</quote>; 
    <quote>an eating doer</quote>), we can still deduce that the seltau refers to an event.</para>
    <para>(You can't 
    <quote>do an eater</quote>/ 
    <jbophrase>gasnu lo citka</jbophrase>, with the meaning of 
    <valsi>do</valsi> as 
    <quote>bring about an event</quote>; so the seltau must refer to an event, 
    <jbophrase>nu citka</jbophrase>. The English slang meanings of 
    <quote>do someone</quote>, namely 
    <quote>socialize with someone</quote> and 
    <quote>have sex with someone</quote>, are not relevant to 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>.)</para>
    <para>So we can simply use 
    <valsi>ctigau</valsi> with the same place structure as 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi>:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-ITvd">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d5"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>agent g1 causes c1 to eat c2</content></definition></para>
      <para><definition><content>g1 feeds c2 to c1</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>This particular kind of asymmetrical lujvo, in which the seltau serves as the selbri of an abstraction which is a place of the tertau, is called an implicit-abstraction lujvo, because one deduces the presence of an abstraction which is unexpressed (implicit).</para>
    
    
    <para>To give another example: the gismu 
    <valsi>basti</valsi>, whose place structure is</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-3LIm">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d6"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>b1 replaces b2 in circumstances b3</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>can form the lujvo 
    <valsi>basygau</valsi>, with the place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-byp8">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d7"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>g1 (agent) replaces b1 with b2 in circumstances b3</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>where both 
    <valsi>basti</valsi> and 
    <valsi>basygau</valsi> are translated 
    <quote>replace</quote> in English, but represent different relations: 
    <valsi>basti</valsi> may be used with no mention of any agent doing the replacing.</para>
    <para>In addition, 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>-based lujvo can be built from what we would consider nouns or adjectives in English. In Lojban, everything is a predicate, so adjectives, nouns and verbs are all treated in the same way. This is consistent with the use of similar causative affixes in other languages. For example, the gismu 
    
    
    
    <valsi>litki</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>liquid</quote>, with the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-tDsX">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d8"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>l1 is a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>can give 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>to liquefy</quote>:</para>
    
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-p5Bt">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d9"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>g1 (agent) causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3.</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>While 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi> correctly represents 
    <quote>causes to be a liquid</quote>, a different lujvo based on 
    <valsi>galfi</valsi> (meaning 
    <quote>modify</quote>) may be more appropriate for 
    <quote>causes to become a liquid</quote>. On the other hand, 
    <valsi>fetsygau</valsi> is potentially confusing, because it could mean 
    <quote>agent in the event of something becoming female</quote> (the implicit-abstraction interpretation) or simply 
    <quote>female agent</quote> (the parallel interpretation), so using implicit-abstraction lujvo is always accompanied with some risk of being misunderstood.</para>
    
    
    <para>Many other Lojban gismu have places for event abstractions, and therefore are good candidates for the tertau of an implicit-abstraction lujvo. For example, lujvo based on 
    
    
    
    <valsi>rinka</valsi>, with its place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Pmz8">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d10"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>event r1 causes event r2 to occur</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>are closely related to those based on 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>. However, 
    <valsi>rinka</valsi> is less generally useful than 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>, because its r1 place is another event rather than a person: 
    <jbophrase>lo rinka</jbophrase> is a cause, not a causer. Thus the place structure of 
    <valsi>likyri'a</valsi>, a lujvo analogous to 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi>, is</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-1HT3">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d11"/>
      </title>
      <para>event r1 causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3</para>
    </example>
    <para>and would be useful in translating sentences like 
    <quote>The heat of the sun liquefied the block of ice.</quote></para>
    <para>Implicit-abstraction lujvo are a powerful means in the language of rendering quite verbose bridi into succinct and manageable concepts, and increasing the expressive power of the language.</para>
    
    
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-anomalous-lujvo">
    <title>Anomalous lujvo</title>
    <para>Some lujvo that have been coined and actually employed in Lojban writing do not follow the guidelines expressed above, either because the places that are equivalent in the seltau and the tertau are in an unusual position, or because the seltau and tertau are related in a complex way, or both. An example of the first kind is 
    
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>prayer</quote>, which was mentioned in 
    <xref linkend="section-order-of-places"/>. The gismu places are:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qJEQ">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>lijda</valsi>: l1 is a religion with believers l2 and beliefs l3</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>cusku</valsi>: c1 expresses text c2 to audience c3 in medium c4</para>
    </example>
    <para>and 
    <valsi>selsku</valsi>, the tertau of 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi>, has the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qW3w">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d2"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>s1 is a text expressed by s2 to audience s3 in medium s4</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>Now it is easy to see that the l2 and s2 places are equivalent: the believer in the religion (l2) is the one who expresses the prayer (s2). This is not one of the cases for which a place ordering rule has been given in 
    <xref linkend="section-order-of-places"/> or 
    <xref linkend="section-implicit-abstraction"/>; therefore, for lack of a better rule, we put the tertau places first and the remaining seltau places after them, leading to the place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-41dc">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d3"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>s1 is a prayer expressed by s2=l2 to audience s3 in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>The l3 place (the beliefs of the religion) is dependent on the l1 place (the religion) and so is omitted.</para>
    <para>We could make this lujvo less messy by replacing it with 
    <jbophrase>se seljdasku</jbophrase>, where 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi> is a normal symmetrical lujvo with place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-7Tdb">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d4"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>c1=l2 religiously expresses prayer c2 to audience c3 in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>which, according to the rule expressed in 
    <xref linkend="section-seltau-SE"/>, can be further expressed as 
    <valsi>selseljdasku</valsi>. However, there is no need for the ugly 
    <jbophrase>selsel-</jbophrase> prefix just to get the rules right: 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi> is a reasonable, if anomalous, lujvo.</para>
    <para>However, there is a further problem with 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi>, not resolvable by using 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi>. No veljvo involving just the two gismu 
    <valsi>lijda</valsi> and 
    <valsi>cusku</valsi> can fully express the relationship implicit in prayer. A prayer is not just anything said by the adherents of a religion; nor is it even anything said by them acting as adherents of that religion. Rather, it is what they say under the authority of that religion, or using the religion as a medium, or following the rules associated with the religion, or something of the kind. So the veljvo is somewhat elliptical.</para>
    <para>As a result, both 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi> and 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi> belong to the second class of anomalous lujvo: the veljvo doesn't really supply all that the lujvo requires.</para>
    <para>Another example of this kind of anomalous lujvo, drawn from the tanru lists in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-asymmetric-tanru"/>, is 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>sheepdog</quote>. Clearly a sheepdog is not a dog which is a sheep (the symmetrical interpretation is wrong), nor a dog of the sheep breed (the asymmetrical interpretation is wrong). Indeed, there is simply no overlap in the places of 
    
    
    <valsi>lanme</valsi> and 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> at all. Rather, the lujvo refers to a dog which controls sheep flocks, a 
    <jbophrase>terlanme jitro gerku</jbophrase>, the lujvo from which is 
    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> with place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-TW5Q">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d5"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><content>g1=j1 is a dog that controls sheep flock l3=j2 made up of sheep l1 in activity j3 of dog breed g2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>based on the gismu place structures</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-CXeL">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d6"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>lanme</valsi>: l1 is a sheep of breed l2 belonging to flock l3</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>gerku</valsi>: g1 is a dog of breed g2</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>jitro</valsi>: j1 controls j2 in activity j3</para>
    </example>
    <para>Note that this lujvo is symmetrical between 
    <valsi>lantro</valsi> (sheep-controller) and 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>, but 
    <valsi>lantro</valsi> is itself an asymmetrical lujvo. The l2 place, the breed of sheep, is removed as dependent on l1. However, the lujvo 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi> is both shorter than 
    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> and sufficiently clear to warrant its use: its place structure, however, should be the same as that of the longer lujvo, for which 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi> can be understood as an abbreviation.</para>
    <para>Another example is 
    <valsi>xanmi'e</valsi>, 
    <quote>to command by hand, to beckon</quote>. The component place structures are:</para>
    
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-VjbP">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d7"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>xance</valsi>: xa1 is the hand of xa2</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>minde</valsi>: m1 gives commands to m2 to cause m3 to happen</para>
      
    </example>
    <para>The relation between the seltau and tertau is close enough for there to be an overlap: xa2 (the person with the hand) is the same as m1 (the one who commands). But interpreting 
    
    <valsi>xanmi'e</valsi> as a symmetrical lujvo with an elided 
    <jbophrase>sel-</jbophrase> in the seltau, as if from 
    <jbophrase>se xance minde</jbophrase>, misses the point: the real relation expressed by the lujvo is not just 
    <quote>one who commands and has a hand</quote>, but 
    
    <quote>to command using the hand</quote>. The concept of 
    <quote>using</quote> suggests the gismu

    <valsi>pilno</valsi>, which is not explicit in the veljvo. And it also means that, for a place structure derivation that actually makes sense, rather than being ad-hoc, the Lojbanist should probably go through a derivation for

    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> above, even if he or she decides to stick with a shorter, more convenient form like

    <para>The ordering rule places the things being compared first, and the other seltau places following. Unfortunately the z4 place, which expresses by how much one entity exceeds the other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is different for each lujvo. For example, while 
    <valsi>nelcymau</valsi> has z4 as its fourth place, 
    <valsi>klamau</valsi> has it as its sixth place. In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place can be redundantly tagged with 
    <valsi>vemau</valsi> (for 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi>) or 
    <valsi>veme'a</valsi> (for 
    <valsi>mleca</valsi>) to help make the speaker's intention clear.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>comparative lujvo</primary><secondary>and seltau presupposition</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>octogenarian</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>nonagenarian</primary></indexterm> It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do not presuppose their seltau. Just as in English, saying someone is younger than someone else doesn't imply that they're young in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still younger than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a greater 
    
    
    
    
    
    <jbophrase>ni citno</jbophrase> than the 90-year-old. Similarly, a 5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not considered 
    <quote>old</quote> by most standards.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>comparative lujvo</primary><secondary>against former state</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>former state</primary></indexterm> There are some comparative concepts which are in which the 
    <jbophrase>se zmadu</jbophrase> is difficult to specify. Typically, these involve comparisons implicitly made with a former state of affairs, where stating a z2 place explicitly would be problematic.</para>
    
    <para>In such cases, it is best not to use 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi> and leave the comparison hanging, but to use instead the gismu 
    
    <valsi>zenba</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>increase</quote> (and 
    <valsi>jdika</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>decrease</quote>, in place of 
    <valsi>mleca</valsi>). The gismu 
    <valsi>zenba</valsi> was included in the language precisely in order to capture those notions of increase which 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi> can't quite cope with; in addition, we don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru on something that we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate 
    <quote>I'm stronger now</quote> not as</para>

    <title>Notes on gismu place structures</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>place structure</primary><secondary>gismu</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place structures</secondary></indexterm> Unlike the place structures of lujvo, the place structures of gismu were assigned in a far less systematic way through a detailed case-by-case analysis and repeated reviews with associated changes. (The gismu list is now baselined, so no further changes are contemplated.) Nevertheless, certain regularities were imposed both in the choice of places and in the ordering of places which may be helpful to the learner and the lujvo-maker, and which are therefore discussed here.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place structures</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> The choice of gismu places results from the varying outcome of four different pressures: brevity, convenience, metaphysical necessity, and regularity. (These are also to some extent the underlying factors in the lujvo place structures generated by the methods of this chapter.) The implications of each are roughly as follows:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Brevity tends to remove places: the fewer places a gismu has, the easier it is to learn, and the less specific it is. As mentioned in 
        <xref linkend="section-selecting-places"/>, a brivla with fewer place structures is less specific, and generality is a virtue in gismu, because they must thoroughly blanket all of semantic space.</para>
        
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Convenience tends to increase the number of places: if a concept can be expressed as a place of some existing gismu, there is no need to make another gismu, a lujvo or a fu'ivla for it.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Metaphysical necessity can either increase or decrease places: it is a pressure tending to provide the 
        <quote>right number</quote> of places. If something is part of the essential nature of a concept, then a place must be made for it; on the other hand, if instances of the concept need not have some property, then this pressure will tend to remove the place.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regularity is a pressure which can also either increase or decrease places. If a gismu has a given place, then gismu which are semantically related to it are likely to have the place also.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Here are some examples of gismu place structures, with a discussion of the pressures operating on them:</para>

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>color standards</primary></indexterm> Brevity was the most important goal here, reinforced by one interpretation of metaphysical necessity. There is no mention of color standards here, as many people have pointed out; like all color gismu, 
    
    <valsi>xekri</valsi> is explicitly subjective. Objective color standards can be brought in by an appropriate BAI tag such as 
    
    <valsi>ci'u</valsi> ( 
    
    <quote>in system</quote>; see 
    <xref linkend="section-BAI"/>) or by making a lujvo.</para>

    </example>
    <para>The gismu 
    <valsi>jbena</valsi> contains places for time and location, which few other gismu have: normally, the time and place at which something is done is supplied by a tense tag (see 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tenses"/>). However, providing these places makes 
    <jbophrase>le te jbena</jbophrase> a simple term for 
    <quote>birthday</quote> and 
    <jbophrase>le ve jbena</jbophrase> for 
    <quote>birthplace</quote>, so these places were provided despite their lack of metaphysical necessity.</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-NTJn">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e16d3"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>rinka</valsi>: event r1 is the cause of event r2</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>melting</primary></indexterm> The place structure of 
    <valsi>rinka</valsi> does not have a place for the agent, the one who causes, as a result of the pressure toward metaphysical necessity. A cause-effect relationship does not have to include an agent: an event (such as snow melting in the mountains) may cause another event (such as the flooding of the Nile) without any human intervention or even knowledge.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>as suppliers of agent place</secondary></indexterm> Indeed, there is a general tendency to omit agent places from most gismu except for a few such as 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> and 
    <valsi>zukte</valsi> which are then used as tertau in order to restore the agent place when needed: see 
    <xref linkend="section-implicit-abstraction"/>.</para>

      <para><definition><valsi>cinfo</valsi> <content>c1 is a lion of species/breed c2</content></definition></para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>diversified species</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>general terms</primary></indexterm> The c2 place of 
    <valsi>cinfo</valsi> is provided as a result of the pressure toward regularity. All animal and plant gismu have such an x2 place; although there is in fact only one species of lion, and breeds of lion, though they exist, aren't all that important in talking about lions. The species/breed place must exist for such diversified species as dogs, and for general terms like 
    
    
    <valsi>cinki</valsi> (insect), and are provided for all other animals and plants as a matter of regularity.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place order</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> Less can be said about gismu place structure ordering, but some regularities are apparent. The places tend to appear in decreasing order of psychological saliency or importance. There is an implication within the place structure of 
    <valsi>klama</valsi>, for example, that 
    <jbophrase>lo klama</jbophrase> (the one going) will be talked about more often, and is thus more important, than 
    <jbophrase>lo se klama</jbophrase> (the destination), which is in turn more important than 
    
    <jbophrase>lo xe klama</jbophrase> (the means of transport).</para>
    <para>Some specific tendencies (not really rules) can also be observed. For example, when there is an agent place, it tends to be the first place. Similarly, when a destination and an origin point are mentioned, the destination is always placed just before the origin point. Places such as 
    
    <quote>under conditions</quote> and 
    <quote>by standard</quote>, which often go unfilled, are moved to near the end of the place structure.</para>

    <title>What are attitudinal indicators?</title>
    
    <para>This chapter explains the various words that Lojban provides for expressing attitude and related notions. In natural languages, attitudes are usually expressed by the tone of voice when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by punctuation when writing. For example, the bare words</para>

        <anchor xml:id="c13e1d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>John is coming.</para>
    </example>
    <para>can be made, through tone of voice, to express the speaker's feeling of happiness, pity, hope, surprise, or disbelief. These fine points of tone cannot be expressed in writing. Attitudes are also expressed with various sounds which show up in print as oddly spelled words, such as the 
    
    
    <quote>Oooh!</quote>, 
    <quote>Arrgh!</quote>, 
    <quote>Ugh!</quote>, and 
    <quote>Yecch!</quote> in the title. These are part of the English language; people born to other languages use a different set; yet you won't find any of these words in a dictionary.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal indicators</primary></indexterm> In Lojban, everything that can be spoken can also be written. Therefore, these tones of voice must be represented by explicit words known as 
    <quote>attitudinal indicators</quote>, or just 
    
    <quote>attitudinals</quote>. This rule seems awkward and clunky to English-speakers at first, but is an essential part of the Lojbanic way of doing things.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="lojban-word"><primary>.a'o</primary></indexterm>  

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>word-form for primary</secondary></indexterm> The primary Lojban attitudinals are all the cmavo of the form VV or V'V: one of the few cases where cmavo have been classified solely by their form. There are 39 of these cmavo: all 25 possible vowel pairs of the form V'V, the four standard diphthongs ( 
    
    <valsi>.ai</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.au</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.ei</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>.oi</valsi>), and the ten more diphthongs that are permitted only in these attitudinal indicators and in names and borrowings ( 
    
    
    <valsi>.ia</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.ie</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.ii</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.io</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.iu</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.ua</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.ue</valsi>, 
    
    <valsi>.ui</valsi>, 
    <valsi>.uo</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>.uu</valsi>). Note that each of these cmavo has a period before it, marking the pause that is mandatory before every word beginning with a vowel. Attitudinals, like most of the other kinds of indicators described in this chapter, belong to selma'o UI.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>compound</secondary></indexterm> Attitudinals can also be compound cmavo, of the types explained in Sections 4-8; 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qfgA"/> illustrates one such possibility, the compound attitudinal 
    <valsi>.ianai</valsi>. In attitudinals, 
    
    <jbophrase>-nai</jbophrase> indicates polar negation: the opposite of the simple attitudinal without the 
    <jbophrase>-nai</jbophrase>. Thus, as you might suppose, 
    <valsi>.ia</valsi> expresses belief, since 
    <valsi>.ianai</valsi> expresses disbelief.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>types of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary></indexterm> In addition to the attitudinals, there are other classes of indicators: intensity markers, emotion categories, attitudinal modifiers, observationals, and discursives. All of them are grammatically equivalent, which is why they are treated together in this chapter.</para>
    
    <para>Every indicator behaves in more or less the same way with respect to the grammar of the rest of the language. In general, one or more indicators can be inserted at the beginning of an utterance or after any word. Indicators at the beginning apply to the whole utterance; otherwise, they apply to the word that they follow. More details can be found in 
    <xref linkend="section-scope"/>.</para>
    <para>Throughout this chapter, tables of indicators will be written in four columns. The first column is the cmavo itself. The second column is a corresponding English word, not necessarily a literal translation. The fourth column represents the opposite of the second column, and shows the approximate meaning of the attitudinal when suffixed with 
    <jbophrase>-nai</jbophrase>. The third column, which is sometimes omitted, indicates a neutral point between the second and fourth columns, and shows the approximate meaning of the attitudinal when it is suffixed with 
    <jbophrase>-cu'i</jbophrase>. The cmavo 
    
    <valsi>cu'i</valsi> belongs to selma'o CAI, and is explained more fully in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-intensity-scale"/>.</para>
    <para>One flaw that the English glosses are particularly subject to is that in English it is often difficult to distinguish between expressing your feelings and talking about them, particularly with the limited resource of the written word. So the gloss for 
    
    <valsi>.ui</valsi> should not really be 
    <quote>happiness</quote> but some sound or tone that expresses happiness. However, there aren't nearly enough of those that have unambiguous or obvious meanings in English to go around for all the many, many different emotions Lojban speakers can readily express.</para>
    
    <para>Many indicators of CV'V form are loosely derived from specific gismu. The gismu should be thought of as a memory hook, not an equivalent of the cmavo. Such gismu are shown in this chapter between square brackets, thus: [gismu].</para>
    
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-pure-emotions">
    <title>Pure emotion indicators</title>
    <para>Attitudinals make no claim: they are expressions of attitude, not of facts or alleged facts. As a result, attitudinals themselves have no truth value, nor do they directly affect the truth value of a bridi that they modify. However, since emotional attitudes are carried in your mind, they reflect reactions to that version of the world that the mind is thinking about; this is seldom identical with the real world. At times, we are thinking about our idealized version of the real world; at other times we are thinking about a potential world that might or might not ever exist.</para>
    
    <para>Therefore, there are two groups of attitudinals in Lojban. The 
    <quote>pure emotion indicators</quote> express the way the speaker is feeling, without direct reference to what else is said. These indicators comprise the attitudinals which begin with 
    <letteral>u</letteral> or 
    <letteral>o</letteral> and many of those beginning with 
    <letteral>i</letteral>.</para>
    <para>The cmavo beginning with 
    <letteral>u</letteral> are simple emotions, which represent the speaker's reaction to the world as it is, or as it is perceived to be.</para>

    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qfHA"/>, note that the attitudinal 
    <valsi>.uo</valsi> is translated by an English non-attitudinal phrase: 
    
    <quote>At last!</quote> It is common for the English equivalents of Lojban attitudinals to be short phrases of this sort, with more or less normal grammar, but actually expressions of emotion.</para>
    <para>In particular, both 
    <valsi>.uu</valsi> and 
    <valsi>.u'u</valsi> can be translated into English as 
    
    <quote>I'm sorry</quote>; the difference between these two attitudes frequently causes confusion among English-speakers who use this phrase, leading to responses like 
    <quote>Why are you sorry? It's not your fault!</quote></para>
    <para>It is important to realize that 
    <valsi>.uu</valsi>, and indeed all attitudinals, are meant to be used sincerely, not ironically. In English, the exclamation 
    <quote>Pity!</quote> is just as likely to be ironically intended, but this usage does not extend to Lojban. Lying with attitudinals is (normally) as inappropriate to Lojban discourse as any other kind of lying: perhaps worse, because misunderstood emotions can cause even greater problems than misunderstood statements.</para>

    <valsi>nai</valsi> and

    <valsi>u'u</valsi> can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning 
    
    <quote>I regret that ...</quote>, and 
    <valsi>a'e</valsi> (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning 
    <quote>I'm awake/aware</quote>. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the 
    <quote>logical language</quote> aspect.</para>

These scales run from some extreme value (which we'll call 
    <quote>positive</quote>) to an opposite extreme (which we'll call 
    <quote>negative</quote>). In the tables above, we have seen three points on the scale: 
    <quote>positive</quote>, neutral, and 
    <quote>negative</quote>. The terms 
    <quote>positive</quote> and 
    <quote>negative</quote> are put into quotation marks because they are loaded words when applied to emotions, and the attitudinal system reflects this loading, which is a known cultural bias. Only two of the 
    <quote>positive</quote> words, namely 
    <valsi>.ii</valsi> (fear) and 
    <valsi>.oi</valsi> (pain/complaint), represent emotions commonly thought of as less 
    <quote>virtuous</quote> in most cases than their negative counterparts. But these two were felt to be instinctive, distinct, and very powerful emotions that needed to be expressible in a monosyllable when necessary, while their counterparts are less commonly expressed.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal scales</primary><secondary>rationale for assignment</secondary></indexterm> (Why the overt bias? Because there are a lot of attitudinals and they will be difficult to learn as an entire set. By aligning our scales arbitrarily, we give the monosyllable 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> a useful meaning and make it easier for a novice to recognize at least the positive or negative alignment of an indicator, if not the specific word. Other choices considered were 
    <quote>random</quote> orientation, which would have unknown biases and be difficult to learn, and orientation based on our guesses as to which scale orientations made the most frequent usages shorter, which would be biased in favor of American perceptions of 
    <quote>usefulness</quote>. If bias must exist in our indicator set, it might as well be a known bias that eases learning, and in addition might as well favor a harmonious and positive world-view.)</para>

    <quote>positive</quote> ones (shown below on the left), three 
    <quote>negative</quote> ones (shown below on the right), and a neutral one indicating that no particular attitude on this scale is felt. The following chart indicates the seven positions of the scale and the associated cmavo. All of these cmavo, except 
    <valsi>nai</valsi>, are in selma'o CAI.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitude</primary><secondary>scalar</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>scalar attitude</primary></indexterm> A scalar attitude is expressed by using the attitudinal word, and then following it by the desired scalar intensity. The bias creeps in because the 
    
    <quote>negative</quote> emotions take the extra syllable 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> to indicate their negative position on the axis, and thus require a bit more effort to express.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal scale</primary><secondary>usage</secondary></indexterm> Much of this system is optional. You can express an attitude without a scale indicator, if you don't want to stop and think about how strongly you feel. Indeed, for most attitudinals, we've found that either no scalar value is used, or 
    <valsi>cai</valsi> is used to indicate especially high intensity. Less often, 
    
    <valsi>ru'e</valsi> is used for a recognizably weak intensity, and 
    
    <valsi>cu'i</valsi> is used in response to the attitudinal question 
    
    <valsi>pei</valsi> (see 
    <xref linkend="section-questions-empathy-contours"/>) to indicate that the emotion is not felt.</para>

    <title>The space of emotions</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal scale</primary><secondary>as axis in emotion-space</secondary></indexterm> Each of the attitude scales constitutes an axis in a multi-dimensional space. In effect, given our total so far of 39 scales, we have a 39-dimensional space. At any given time, our emotions and attitudes are represented by a point in this 39-dimensional space, with the intensity indicators serving as coordinates along each dimension. A complete attitudinal inventory, should one decide to express it, would consist of reading off each of the scale values for each of the emotions, with the vector sum serving as a distinct single point, which is our attitude.</para>

If asked, we normally do not recognize more than one or two emotions at a time &ndash; usually the ones that are strongest or which most recently changed in some significant way. But the scale system provides some useful insights into a possible theory of emotion (which might be testable using Lojban), and incidentally explains how Lojbanists express compound emotions when they do recognize them.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal scale</primary><secondary>neutral compared with positive + negative</secondary></indexterm> The existence of 39 scales highlights the complexity of emotion. We also aren't bound to the 39. There are modifiers described in 
    <xref linkend="section-categories"/> that multiply the set of scales by an order of magnitude. You can also have mixed feelings on a scale, which might be expressed by 
    
    
    <valsi>cu'i</valsi>, but could also be expressed by using both the 
    
    <quote>positive</quote> and 
    <quote>negative</quote> scale emotions at once. One expression of 
    <quote>fortitude</quote> might be 
    <jbophrase>.ii.iinai</jbophrase>- fear coupled with security.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>contrasted with rationalizations of emotion</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>order of</secondary></indexterm> Uttering one or more attitudinals to express an emotion reflects several things. We will tend to utter emotions in their immediate order of importance to us. We feel several emotions at once, and our expression reflects these emotions simultaneously, although their order of importance to us is also revealing &ndash; of our attitude towards our attitude, so to speak. There is little analysis necessary; for those emotions you feel, you express them; the 
    <quote>vector sum</quote> naturally expresses the result. This is vital to their nature as attitudinals &ndash; if you had to stop and think about them, or to worry about grammar, they wouldn't be emotions but rationalizations.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>contrasted with bridi</secondary></indexterm> People have proposed that attitudinals be expressed as bridi just like everything else; but emotions aren't logical or analytical &ndash; saying 
    <quote>I'm awed</quote> is not the same as saying 
    <quote>Wow!!!</quote>. The Lojban system is intended to give the effects of an analytical system without the thought involved. Thus, you can simply feel in Lojban.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>design benefit</secondary></indexterm> A nice feature of this design is that you can be simple or complex, and the system works the same way. The most immediate benefit is in learning. You only need to learn a couple of the scale words and a couple of attitude words, and you're ready to express your emotions Lojbanically. As you learn more, you can express your emotions more thoroughly and more precisely, but even a limited vocabulary offers a broad range of expression.</para>

To keep the number of cmavo limited, the emotion words in the list were grouped together by common features: each group was then assigned a separate cmavo. This was like making tanru in reverse, and the result is a collection of indicators that can be combined, like tanru, to express very complex emotions. Some examples in a moment.</para>
    <para>The most significant 
    <quote>common feature</quote> we identified was that the emotional words on the list could easily be broken down into six major groups, each of which was assigned its own cmavo:</para>

    <para> Using these, we were able to assign 
    <valsi>o'u</valsi> to mark a scale of what we might call 
    
    <quote>generalized comfort</quote>. When you are comfortable, relaxed, satisfied, you express comfort with 
    <valsi>o'u</valsi>, possibly followed by a scale indicator to indicate how comfortable you are. The six cmavo given above allow you to turn this scale into six separate ones, should you wish.</para>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal categories</primary><secondary>example of effect</secondary></indexterm> For example, embarrassment is a social discomfort, expressible as 
    
    <jbophrase>.o'unairo'a</jbophrase>. Some emotions that we label 
    <quote>stress</quote> in English are expressed in Lojban with 
    <jbophrase>.o'unairo'i</jbophrase>. Physical distress can be expressed with 
    <jbophrase>.o'unairo'o</jbophrase>, which makes a nice groan if you say it with feeling. Mental discomfort might be what you feel when you don't know the answer to the test question, but feel that you should. Most adults can recall some instance where we felt sexual discomfort, 
    
    <jbophrase>o'unairo'u</jbophrase>. Spiritual discomfort, 
    <jbophrase>o'unaire'e</jbophrase>, might be felt by a church-goer who has wandered into the wrong kind of religious building.</para>
    <para>Most of the time when expressing an emotion, you won't categorize it with these words. Emotional expressions should be quickly expressible without having to think about them. However, we sometimes have mixed emotions within this set, as for example emotional discomfort coupled with physical comfort or vice versa.</para>
    <para> Coupling these six words with our 39 attitude scales, each of which has a positive and negative side, already gives you far more emotional expression words than we have emotional labels in English. Thus, you'll never see a Lojban-English emotional dictionary that covers all the Lojban possibilities. Some may be useless, but others convey emotions that probably never had a word for them before, though many have felt them ( 
    <jbophrase>.eiro'u</jbophrase>, for example &ndash; look it up).</para>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal modifiers</primary></indexterm> It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among emotions. These tended to fit nicely on scales of their own, but generally tend not to be thought of as separate emotions. Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in context. Some of these tend to go well with only a few of the attitudinals, others go with nearly all of them. To really understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with one or two of the attitudinals found in 
    <xref linkend="section-pure-emotions"/> and 
    <xref linkend="section-propositional-emotions"/>, and see what emotional pictures you can build:</para>
    
    <para> 

  The cmavo 
    <valsi>ga'i</valsi> expresses the scale used to indicate condescension or polite deference; it is not respect in general, which is 
    
    
    
    <valsi>.io</valsi>. Whatever it is attached to is marked as being below (for 
    <valsi>ga'i</valsi>) or above (for 
    
    <valsi>ga'inai</valsi>) the speaker's rank or social position. Note that it is always the referent, not the speaker or listener, who is so marked: in order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the sentence, as with 
    
    <jbophrase>doi ga'inai</jbophrase>, which can be appended to a statement addressed to a social superior.</para>

    <para>Since 
    <valsi>ga'i</valsi> expresses the relative rank of the speaker and the referent, it does not make much sense to attach it to 
    
    <valsi>mi</valsi>, unless the speaker is using 
    <valsi>mi</valsi> to refer to a group (as in English 
    <quote>we</quote>), or a past or future version of himself with a different rank.</para>
    <para>It is also possible to attach 
    <valsi>ga'i</valsi> to a whole bridi, in which case it expresses the speaker's superiority to the event the bridi refers to:</para>

    <para> The cmavo 
    <valsi>le'o</valsi> represents the scale of aggressiveness.

    <para> The cmavo

    <xref linkend="section-categories"/> when it is felt on an easy test, as opposed to on a hard test. When someone gives you a back massage, you could use

    <para> The cmavo 
    <valsi>be'u</valsi> expresses, roughly speaking, whether the emotion it modifies is in response to something you don't have enough of, something you have enough of, or something you have too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of the subjective quantifier cmavo 
    
    <valsi>mo'a</valsi>,

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>complexity</secondary></indexterm> Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to use. They might be for most circumstances. It is likely that most combinations will never get used. But if one person uses one of these expressions, another person can understand (as unambiguously as the expresser intends) what emotion is being expressed. Most probably as the system becomes well-known and internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not cliches) of emotion.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>meaning when compounded</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>grammar for compounding</secondary></indexterm> The grammar of indicators is quite simple; almost all facets are optional. You can combine indicators in any order, and they are still grammatical. The presumed denotation is additive; thus the whole is the sum of the parts regardless of the order expressed, although the first expressed is presumed most important to the speaker. Every possible string of UI cmavo has some meaning.</para>

Each of the modifier words is presumed to modify an indicator to the left, if there is one. (There is an 
    <quote>unspecified emotion</quote> word, 
    
    <valsi>ge'e</valsi>, reserved to ensure that if you want to express a modifier without a root emotion, it doesn't attach to and modify a previous but distinct emotional expression.)</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>unspecified level of emotion</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>unstated emotion</primary></indexterm> For example, 
    <jbophrase>.ieru'e</jbophrase> expresses a weak positive value on the scale of agreement: the speaker agrees (presumably with the listener or with something else just stated), but with the least possible degree of intensity. But 
    <jbophrase>.ie ge'eru'e</jbophrase> expresses agreement (at an unspecified level), followed by some other unstated emotion which is felt at a weak level. A rough English equivalent of 
    
    <jbophrase>.ie ge'eru'e</jbophrase> might be 
    <quote>I agree, but ...</quote> where the 
    <quote>but</quote> is left hanging. (Again, attitudes aren't always expressed in English by English attitudinals.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinal indicators</primary><secondary>placement of scale in</secondary></indexterm> A scale variable similarly modifies the previous emotion word. You put the scale word for a root emotion word before a modifier, since the latter can have its own scale word. This merely maximizes the amount of information expressible. For example, 
    <jbophrase>.oinaicu'i ro'ucai</jbophrase> expresses a feeling midway between pain ( 
    <valsi>.oi</valsi>) and pleasure ( 
    <valsi>.oinai</valsi>) which is intensely sexual ( 
    <valsi>ro'u</valsi>) in nature.</para>

    <valsi>nai</valsi> is the most tightly bound modifier in the language: it always negates exactly one word &ndash; the preceding one. Of all the words used in indicator constructs, 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> is the only one with any meaning outside the indicator system. If you try to put an indicator between a non-indicator cmavo and its 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> negator, the 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> will end up negating the last word of the indicator. The result, though unambiguous, is not what you want. For example,</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>external grammar</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>grammar of placement in bridi</secondary></indexterm> The behavior of indicators in the 
    <quote>outside grammar</quote> is nearly as simple as their internal structure. Indicator groupings are identified immediately after the metalinguistic erasers 
    
    <valsi>si</valsi>, 
    <valsi>sa</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>su</valsi> and some, though not all, kinds of quotations. The details of such interactions are discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-cmavo-interactions"/>.</para>
    <para> A group of indicators may appear anywhere that a single indicator may, except in those few situations (as in 
    <valsi>zo</valsi> quotation, explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-more-quotations"/>) where compound cmavo may not be used.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>at beginning of text</secondary></indexterm> At the beginning of a text, indicators modify everything following them indefinitely: such a usage is taken as a raw emotional expression, and we normally don't turn off our emotions when we start and stop sentences. In every other place in an utterance, the indicator (or group) attaches to the word immediately to its left, and indicates that the attitude is being expressed concerning the object or concept to which the word refers.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>affecting whole grammatical structures</secondary></indexterm> If the word that an indicator (or group) attaches to is itself a cmavo which governs a grammatical structure, then the indicator construct pertains to the referent of the entire structure. There is also a mechanism, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-attitudinal-scope"/>, for explicitly marking the range of words to which an indicator applies.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>referent uncertainty</secondary></indexterm> More details about the uses of indicators, and the way they interact with other specialized cmavo, are given in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-structure"/>. It is worth mentioning that real-world interpretation is not necessarily consistent with the formal scope rules. People generally express emotions when they feel them, with only a minimum of grammatical constraint on that expression; complexities of emotional expression are seldom logically analyzable. Lojban attempts to provide a systematic reference that could possibly be ingrained to an instinctive level. However, it should always be assumed that the referent of an indicator has some uncertainty.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>multiple indicators</primary></indexterm> For example, in cases of multiple indicators expressed together, the combined form has some ambiguity of interpretation. It is possible to interpret the second indicator as expressing an attitude about the first, or to interpret both as expressing attitudes about the common referent. For example, in</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>can be interpreted as expressing complaint about the anger, in which case it means 
    <quote>Damn, I snapped at you</quote>; or as expressing both anger and complaint about the listener, in which case it means 
    <quote>I told you, you pest!</quote></para>
    <para>Similarly, an indicator after the final brivla of a tanru may be taken to express an attitude about the particular brivla placed there &ndash; as the rules have it &ndash; or about the entire bridi which hinges on that brivla. Remembering that indicators are supposedly direct expressions of emotion, this ambiguity is acceptable.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitudinals</primary><secondary>benefit in written expression</secondary></indexterm> Even if the scope rules given for indicators turn out to be impractical or unintuitive for use in conversation, they are still useful in written expression. There, where you can go back and put in markers or move words around, the scope rules can be used in lieu of elaborate nuances of body language and intonation to convey the writer's intent.</para>

The indicators known as 
    
    <quote>evidentials</quote> show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Láadan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Láadan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>evidentials</primary><secondary>in English</secondary></indexterm> It is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.</para>

    <quote>indisputable</quote>, in the sense that the speaker is saying 
    <quote>how it is with him or her</quote>, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>evidentials</primary><secondary>placement in bridi</secondary></indexterm> Evidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the 
    <valsi>i</valsi> that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.</para>

  A bridi marked by

    <valsi>ca'e</valsi> is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is 
    
    <quote>I now pronounce you husband and wife</quote>, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:</para>

 A bridi marked by 
    <valsi>pe'i</valsi> is the opinion of the speaker. The form 
    
    
    <jbophrase>pe'ipei</jbophrase> is common, meaning 
    
    <quote>Is this your opinion?</quote>. (Strictly, this should be 
    
    <jbophrase>peipe'i</jbophrase>, in accordance with the distinction explained in Examples 10.6-10.8, but since 
    <valsi>pe'i</valsi> is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)</para>

  Finally, the evidential 
    <valsi>ju'a</valsi> is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using 
    
    
    <valsi>ju'a</valsi> is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: 
    
    <jbophrase>ju'apei</jbophrase> means 
    
    <quote>What is the basis for your statement?</quote> and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.</para>

    <quote>I also came</quote>, we would have to say 
    <quote>I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence</quote>, which is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases like

The first four are used in consecutive discourse. The first, 
    <valsi>ku'i</valsi>, makes an exception to the previous argument. The second, 
    
    <valsi>ji'a</valsi>, adds weight to the previous argument. The third, 
    
    <valsi>si'a</valsi>, adds quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, 
    
    <valsi>mi'u</valsi>, adds a parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from 
    
    <valsi>go'i</valsi> (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-ri-gohi-series"/>), which is a non-discursive version of 
    <quote>ditto</quote> that explicitly repeats the claim of the previous bridi.</para>
    
    <para> 

 Lastly, 
    <valsi>po'o</valsi> is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of 
    
    <quote>only</quote>, a word difficult to express in pure bridi form:</para>

    <valsi>ta'u</valsi> marks the transition from the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the discursive

In speech, the tone of voice often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise discourse is often simply clueless.

    <valsi>je'unai</valsi> be used, or 
    <valsi>je'u</valsi> be useful? For one thing, 
    <valsi>je'u</valsi> can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like 
    <quote>All cats are cats.</quote> Its counterpart 
    <valsi>je'unai</valsi> then serves to mark a logical contradiction. In addition, 
    <valsi>je'unai</valsi> can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with 
    
    
    
    <valsi>zo'o</valsi> (humor) or

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>confusion about what was said</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>confusion</primary><secondary>metalinguistic</secondary></indexterm> The cmavo 
    <valsi>ki'a</valsi> is one of the most common of the miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is 
    <valsi>.uanai</valsi>). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English 
    <quote>which</quote> corresponds to 
    <valsi>ki'a</valsi>:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-gWFX">

        <jbo>mi nelci le ctuca</jbo>

        <natlang>I like the teacher</natlang>
        <natlang>Which teacher?</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti 
    <jbophrase>le ctuca</jbophrase>, and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>invalid speech</primary><secondary>marking as error with na'i</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>error marking</primary><secondary>metalinguistic</secondary></indexterm> The metalinguistic negation cmavo 
    
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> and its opposite 
    <valsi>jo'a</valsi> are explained in full in 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-negation"/>. In general, 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> indicates that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>valid speech</primary><secondary>marking as error with jo'a</secondary></indexterm> Similarly, 
    <valsi>jo'a</valsi> marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct. These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: 
    
    <jbophrase>na'inai</jbophrase> means the same as 
    <valsi>jo'a</valsi>, but would be too confusing as an affirmation; 
    
    <jbophrase>jo'anai</jbophrase> means the same as 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi>, but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic negator.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>partial quotation</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>fragmentary text</primary></indexterm> The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text grammatical. The cmavo 
    
    <valsi>li'o</valsi> serves the former function. It indicates that words were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical, however, as 
    
    <valsi>li'o</valsi> does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example, take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a description sumti: 
    
    <jbophrase valid="false">le li'o</jbophrase> in isolation is not grammatical.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sa'a</primary><secondary>interaction with to'i</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>sa'a</primary><secondary>interaction with sei</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>sa'a</primary><secondary>interaction with li'o</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>editorial insertion</primary><secondary>with &quot;sa'a</secondary></indexterm> The cmavo 
    <valsi>sa'a</valsi> indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical purposes. Strictly, even a 
    
    <valsi>li'o</valsi> should appear in the form 
    
    <jbophrase>li'osa'a</jbophrase>, since the 
    <valsi>li'o</valsi> was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as 
    
    <valsi>sei</valsi> (of selma'o SEI) or 
    <valsi>to'i</valsi> (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion might result.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sa'a</primary><secondary>editorial insertion of text already containing sa'a</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>editorial insertion</primary><secondary>of text already containing sa'a</secondary></indexterm> In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances of 
    <valsi>sa'a</valsi>, they can be changed to 
    
    <jbophrase>sa'asa'a</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>questions</primary><secondary>with &quot;xu&quot;</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth questions</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>yes/no questions</primary></indexterm> The cmavo 
    <valsi>xu</valsi> marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in 
    <xref linkend="section-truth-questions"/>. In general, 
    <valsi>xu</valsi> may be translated 
    <quote>Is it true that ... ?</quote> and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When 
    <valsi>xu</valsi> is attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to that word or construct.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>questions</primary><secondary>marking in advance</secondary></indexterm> Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo 
    <valsi>pau</valsi> at the beginning of a bridi helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark. The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>questions</primary><secondary>rhetorical</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>rhetorical question</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>pau</primary><secondary>placement in sentence</secondary></indexterm> Although 
    <valsi>pau</valsi> is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite, 
    
    <valsi>paunai</valsi>, signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text near the beginning of 
    
    
    <xref linkend="section-evidentials"/>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>figurative speech</primary></indexterm> The cmavo 
    <valsi>pe'a</valsi> is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:</para>
    
    
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-rXiR">

        <natlang>I see the 
        <quote>blue</quote> house.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of 
    <valsi>pe'a</valsi> unambiguously marks a cultural reference: 
    
    <valsi>blanu</valsi> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-rXiR"/> could mean 
    <quote>sad</quote> (as in English) or something completely different.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>literally</primary></indexterm> The negated form, 
    <jbophrase>pe'anai</jbophrase>, indicates that what has been said is to be interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to be ignored.</para>
    
    <para> 

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>heartburn</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

    <valsi>pe'a</valsi> has a rafsi, namely 
    
    <rafsi>pev</rafsi>. This rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus 
    <valsi>risnyjelca</valsi> (heart burn) might have a place structure like:</para>
    <definition><content>x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4</content></definition>
    <para>whereas 
    <valsi>pevrisnyjelca</valsi>, explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place structure:</para>
    <definition><content>x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2</content></definition>
    <para>which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either 
    <valsi>risna</valsi> or 
    <valsi>jelca</valsi>.</para>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>a/an</primary><secondary>contrasted with the</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>the</primary><secondary>contrasted with a/an</secondary></indexterm> The uses of 
    <valsi>bi'u</valsi> and 
    
    <valsi>bi'unai</valsi> correspond to one of the uses of the English articles 
    
    
    <quote>the</quote> and 
    <quote>a/an</quote>. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with 
    <quote>I saw a man who ...</quote>. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the phrase 
    <quote>the man</quote>. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both 
    
    <quote>a man</quote> and 
    <quote>the man</quote> would be translated 
    <jbophrase>le nanmu</jbophrase>, since the speaker has in mind a specific man. However, the first use might be marked 
    <jbophrase>le bi'u nanmu</jbophrase>, to indicate that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be tagged 
    
    <jbophrase>le bi'unai nanmu</jbophrase>.</para>
    
    <para>Most of the time, the distinction between 
    <valsi>bi'u</valsi> and 
    
    <valsi>bi'unai</valsi> need not be made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were referred to still later in the story, 
    
    <jbophrase>le bi'u nanmu</jbophrase> would clearly show that this man was different from the previous one.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>attitude</primary><secondary>avoidance of expression</secondary></indexterm> Finally, the indicator

    <xref linkend="section-compound-attitudinals"/> and 
    <xref linkend="section-questions-empathy-contours"/>. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.</para>
    <para>Another use for 
    <valsi>ge'e</valsi> is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: 
    
    <jbophrase>.iige'e</jbophrase> means roughly

The vocatives actually are indicators &ndash; in fact, discursives &ndash; but the need to tie them to names and other descriptions of listeners requires them to be separated from selma'o UI. But like the cmavo of UI, the members of selma'o COI can be 
    <quote>negated</quote> with 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> to get the opposite part of the scale.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>vocatives</primary><secondary>rationale for redundancy</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>redundancy</primary><secondary>effect on vocative design</secondary></indexterm> Because of the need for redundancy in noisy environments, the Lojban design does not compress the vocatives into a minimum number of scales. Doing so would make a non-redundant 
    
    
    <valsi>nai</valsi> too often vital to interpretation of a protocol signal, as explained later in this section.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>vocatives</primary><secondary>grammar overview</secondary></indexterm> The grammar of vocatives is explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-vocative-syntax"/>; but in brief, a vocative may be followed by a name (without 
    <valsi>la</valsi>), a description (without 
    <valsi>le</valsi> or its relatives), a complete sumti, or nothing at all (if the addressee is obvious from the context). There is an elidable terminator, 
    <valsi>do'u</valsi> (of selma'o DOhU) which is almost never required unless no name (or other indication of the addressee) follows the vocative.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>vocatives</primary><secondary>and definition of &quot;you&quot;</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>you</primary><secondary>defining</secondary></indexterm> Using any vocative except 
    <valsi>mi'e</valsi> (explained below) implicitly defines the meaning of the pro-sumti 
    <valsi>do</valsi>, as the whole point of vocatives is to specify the listener, or at any rate the desired listener &ndash; even if the desired listener isn't listening! We will use the terms 
    <quote>speaker</quote> and 
    <quote>listener</quote> for clarity, although in written Lojban the appropriate terms would be 
    <quote>writer</quote> and 
    <quote>reader</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>vocatives</primary><secondary>notation convention symbol &quot;X&quot;</secondary></indexterm> In the following list of vocatives, the translations include the symbol X. This represents the name (or identifying description, or whatever) of the listener.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>doi</primary><secondary>effect on pause before name</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>pause before name</primary><secondary>effect of doi</secondary></indexterm> The cmavo 
    <valsi>doi</valsi> is the general-purpose vocative. Unlike the cmavo of selma'o COI, explained below, 
    <valsi>doi</valsi> can precede a name directly without an intervening pause. It is not considered a scale, and 
    <jbophrase valid="false">doinai</jbophrase> is not grammatical. In general, 
    <valsi>doi</valsi> needs no translation in English (we just use names by themselves without any preceding word, although in poetic styles we sometimes say 
    <quote>Oh X</quote>, which is equivalent to 
    <valsi>doi</valsi>). One may attach an attitudinal to 
    <valsi>doi</valsi> to express various English vocatives. For example, 
    <jbophrase>doi .io</jbophrase> means 
    <quote>Sir/Madam!</quote>, whereas 
    <jbophrase>doi .ionai</jbophrase> means 
    
    <quote>You there!</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>COI selma'o</primary><secondary>effect on pause before name</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>pause before name</primary><secondary>effect of vocatives of COI</secondary></indexterm> All members of selma'o COI require a pause when used immediately before a name, in order to prevent the name from absorbing the COI word. This is unlike selma'o DOI and LA, which do not require pauses because the syllables of these cmavo are not permitted to be embedded in a Lojban name. When calling out to someone, this is fairly natural, anyway. 
    <quote>Hey! John!</quote> is thus a better translation of 
    <jbophrase>ju'i .djan.</jbophrase> than 
    
    <quote>Hey John!</quote>. No pause is needed if the vocative reference is something other than a name, as in the title of the Lojban journal, 
    <jbophrase>ju'i lobypli</jbophrase>.</para>
    
    <para>(Alternatively, 
    <valsi>doi</valsi> can be inserted between the COI cmavo and the name, making a pause unnecessary: 
    <jbophrase>coi doi djan.</jbophrase>)</para>

This form of translation does not mean that Lojban is a language of CB enthusiasts, but rather that in most natural languages these forms are so well handled by the context that only in specific domains (like speaking on the radio) do they need special words. In Lojban, dependence on the context can be dangerous, as speaker and listener may not share the right context, and so the vocatives provide a formal protocol for use when it is appropriate. Other appropriate contexts include computer communications and parliamentary procedure: in the latter context, the protocol question

There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.</para>
    
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>rationale for selection</secondary></indexterm> We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo 
    <valsi>sei</valsi>, explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-parentheses"/>, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>evolutionary development of</secondary></indexterm> We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?</para>
    
    <para>There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally &ndash; mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.</para>
    
    
    <para>Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions &ndash; words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>emotions</primary><secondary>research using indicators</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>emotions</primary><secondary>recording using indicators</secondary></indexterm> There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>emotions</primary><secondary>cultural bias of expression</secondary></indexterm> The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias &ndash; if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>Sapir-Whorf effects</primary><secondary>and emotional indicators</secondary></indexterm> Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.</para>
    <para>It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication 
    <quote>at our mother's knee</quote>. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>emotional indicators</primary><secondary>noticeable effects of</secondary></indexterm> We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our 
    <quote>logical language</quote> will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth functions</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical language</primary><secondary>truth functions</secondary></indexterm> Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means 
    
    <quote>logical language</quote>. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a 
    
    <quote>sentence</quote> (sometimes called a 
    <quote>statement</quote> or 
    <quote>proposition</quote>), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of 
    <quote>truth functions</quote>, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-mJ6y">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e1d1"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>man or woman</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>John is a man or James is a woman.</para>
    </example>
    <para> 


 is true if 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true, or if 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether 
    <quote>John is a man or James is a woman</quote> is true, provided we know the meaning of 
    <quote>or</quote>. Here 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> and 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> are the component sentences.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>negating a sentence</primary><secondary>and truth value</secondary></indexterm> We will use the phrase 
    <quote>negating a sentence</quote> to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing 
    
    <quote>It is false that ...</quote>, or more idiomatically by inserting 
    <quote>not</quote> at the right point, generally before the verb. 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote> is the negation of 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation 
    <quote>Not!</quote></para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary></indexterm> Words like 
    <quote>or</quote> are called 
    <quote>logical connectives</quote>, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as 
    
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>and/or</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>only if</quote>, 
    <quote>whether or not</quote>, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</para>
    <para>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth table</primary><secondary>explanation</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>truth functions</primary><secondary>16 possible</secondary></indexterm> There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for

    <title>The six types of logical connectives</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>rationale for multiple sets in grammar</secondary></indexterm> In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>Consider the English sentence:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-ptgf">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e3d1"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>window</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para>Mary went to the window and ...</para>
      
    </example>
    <para> 


 where the last word could be followed by 
    <quote>the door</quote>, a noun phrase, or by 
    <quote>saw the horses</quote>, a sentence with subject omitted, or by 
    <quote>John went to the door</quote>, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="lojban-word"><primary>JA selma'o</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>selma'o</secondary><tertiary>enumerated</tertiary></indexterm> Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>cmavo</secondary><tertiary>format for each selma'o</tertiary></indexterm> Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> is 
    <valsi>a</valsi>. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, which is a truth function, or 
    <valsi>a</valsi>, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> in selma'o GIhA is 
    <valsi>gi'e</valsi>, and the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> in selma'o GA is 
    <valsi>gu</valsi>. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>compound logical connectives</primary><secondary>components</secondary></indexterm> Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-connectives-introduction"/>. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo 
    <valsi>se</valsi>, 
    <valsi>na</valsi>, or 
    <valsi>nai</valsi>. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="lojban-word"><primary>JA selma'o</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>jek</primary><secondary>definition</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>ek</primary><secondary>definition</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>-ek</primary><secondary>in name for logical connectives</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>compound logical connectives</primary><secondary>naming convention</secondary></indexterm> For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used for logical connection is designated by a Lojban name. The name is derived by changing the final 
    <quote>-A</quote> of the selma'o name to 
    <quote>-ek</quote>; the reasons for using 
    <quote>-ek</quote> are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use 
    <quote>eks</quote> as the plural of 
    
    <quote>ek</quote>.) When the term 
    <quote>logical connective</quote> is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="lojban-word"><primary>JA selma'o</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>ijek</primary><secondary>definition</secondary></indexterm> Why does the title of this section refer to 
    <quote>six types</quote> when there are only five selma'o? A jek may be preceded by 
    <valsi>i</valsi>, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences. The compound produced by 
    <valsi>i</valsi> followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.</para>

    <para>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in

    <quote>John is a man if James is a woman</quote> seems to be neither true nor false, since it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most convenient to treat this 
    <quote>if</quote> as TTFT, which on investigation means that 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-FXSC"/> is true.

    <valsi>bo</valsi> (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if 
    <valsi>bo</valsi> is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with 
    <valsi>bo</valsi> are interpreted before connections not so marked.

    <valsi>tu'e</valsi> and

    <valsi>ke</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>complex logical connectives</primary><secondary>grouping with parentheses</secondary></indexterm> But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:</para>

    <title>Logical connection within tanru</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>logical connectives in tanru</primary></indexterm> As noted at the beginning of 
    <xref linkend="section-compound-bridi"/>, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru 
    <jbophrase>blanu zdani</jbophrase>, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of 
    <jbophrase>blanu bolci</jbophrase>, Lojbanists can say 
    <jbophrase>blanu je bolci</jbophrase>, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in 
    <xref linkend="section-termsets"/> also, but there they were always prefixed by 
    <valsi>pe'e</valsi>; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:</para>

    <title>Tenses, modals, and logical connection</title>
    <para> The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo 
    <valsi>pu</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ca</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>ba</valsi> (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a 
    <jbophrase>le nu</jbophrase> abstraction; see 
    <xref linkend="section-events"/>).</para>

    <title>Introductory</title>
    <para>The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation, simply put, is to come up with a complete definition of the word 
    <quote>not</quote>. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar, this means further that meanings of 
    <quote>not</quote> with different grammatical effect must be different words, and even different grammatical structures.</para>
    <para>Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into Lojban's logical connectives and other structures.</para>
    
    <para>In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are typically called 
    <quote>subject</quote> and 
    <quote>predicate</quote>. In the statement</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-vrXe">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>John goes to the store</para>
    </example>
    <para>
      <quote>John</quote> is the subject, and 
      <quote>goes to the store</quote> is the predicate. Negating 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-vrXe"/> to produce</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-gm3I">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d2"/>
      </title>
      <para>John doesn't go to the store.</para>
    </example>
    <para>has the effect of declaring that the predicate does not hold for the subject. 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gm3I"/> says nothing about whether John goes somewhere else, or whether someone else besides John goes to the store.</para>
    <para>We will call this kind of negation 
    <quote>natural language negation</quote>. This kind of negation is difficult to manipulate by the tools of logic, because it doesn't always follow the rules of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is true, or it is false. If a statement is false, then its negation must be true. Such negation is termed contradictory negation.</para>
    <para>Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation can violate the rules of contradictory negation.</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qGWR">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d3"/>
      </title>
      <para>Some animals are not white.</para>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qgXI">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d4"/>
      </title>
      <para>Some animals are white.</para>
    </example>
    <para>Both of these statements are true; yet one is apparently the negation of the other. Another example:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qgxL">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d5"/>
      </title>
      <para>I mustn't go to the dance.</para>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qGXL">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e1d6"/>
      </title>
      <para>I must go to the dance.</para>
    </example>
    <para>At first thought, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qgxL"/> negates 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qGXL"/>. Thinking further, we realize that there is an intermediate state wherein I am permitted to go to the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible that both statements are false.</para>
    <para>Sometimes order is significant:</para>

      <para>Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.</para>

    <para>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qgyb"/> is written in what is called the 
    <quote>active voice</quote>, we immediately get confused about whether 
    <quote>the falling rock</quote> is a suitable subject for the predicate 
    <quote>did kill Sam</quote>. 
    <quote>Kill</quote> implies volition to us, and rocks do not have volition. This confusion is employed by opponents of gun control who use the argument 
    <quote>Guns don't kill people; people kill people.</quote></para>
    <para>Somehow, we don't have the same problem with 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qGYX"/>. The subject is Sam, and we determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.</para>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qGYX"/> also helps us focus on the fact that there are at least two questionable facts implicit in this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and if so, whether the falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of what killed him is moot.</para>
    <para>This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject of the sentence turns out not to exist:</para>

    <title>bridi negation</title>
    <para>In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement 
    <quote>bridi negation</quote>. Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of 
    <quote>I haven't stopped beating my wife</quote> without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning simply 
    <quote>It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.</quote> Since Lojban uses bridi as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these components as well at the sentence level.</para>
    <para>For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the truth of the entire sentence.

    </example>
    <para>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.</para>
    <para>The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo 
    <valsi>na</valsi> of selma'o NA before the selbri of the affirmative form of the bridi (but after the 
    <valsi>cu</valsi>, if there is one):</para>

        <gloss>I [false] go-to the store.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi negation is present. We would like to use the word 
    <quote>not</quote>, because this highlights the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation with 
    <valsi>na</valsi> and natural language negation with 
    <quote>not</quote>. In English, the word 
    <quote>not</quote> can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire sentence. In addition, 
    <quote>not</quote> may indicate either contradictory negation or another form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.</para>
    
    <para>Because of the ambiguity of English 
    <quote>not</quote>, we will use 
    <quote>[false]</quote> in the translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Although there is this fundamental difference between Lojban's internal bridi negation and English negation, we note that in many cases, especially when there are no existential or quantified variables (the cmavo 
    
    
    <valsi>da</valsi>, 
    <valsi>de</valsi>, and 
    <valsi>di</valsi> of selma'o KOhA, explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-quantifiers"/>) in the bridi, you can indeed translate Lojban 
    <valsi>na</valsi> as 
    <quote>not</quote> (or 
    <quote>isn't</quote> or 
    <quote>doesn't</quote>, as appropriate).</para>
    <para>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.</para>
    <para>In Lojban, there are several structures that implicitly contain bridi, so that Lojban sentences may contain more than one occurrence of 
    <valsi>na</valsi>. For example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-WU9u">

        <gloss>It is not the case that I am happy about it not being the case that I am going to the dance.</gloss>
        <natlang>I am not happy about not going to the dance.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In the previous example, we used internal negations in abstraction bridi; bridi negation may also be found in descriptions within sumti. For example:</para>
    
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-N65f">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e2d9"/>

        <natlang>I am fond of the one who isn't beautiful.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>A more extreme (and more indefinite) example is:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-eQaI">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e2d10"/>

        <natlang>I am fond of one who isn't the current king of France.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The claim of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-eQaI"/> could apply to anyone except a person who is fond of no one at all, since the relation within the description is false for everyone. You cannot readily express these situations in colloquial English.</para>
    
    <para>Negation with 
    <valsi>na</valsi> applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri. Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put 
    <valsi>na</valsi> inside a tanru. In fact, the grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other forms of negation.</para>
    
    <para>The grammar of 
    <valsi>na</valsi> allows multiple adjacent negations, which cancel out, as in normal logic:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-RJKu">

        <gloss>This is a big-person that is (beautiful to me).</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with 
    <valsi>na</valsi> is permitted in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular, it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:</para>

    </example>
    <para>mean the same thing with 
    <valsi>na</valsi> before the 
    <valsi>ta'e</valsi>, as when the negation occurs afterwards; we'll let future, Lojban-speaking, logicians decide on how they relate to each other.</para>
    
    <para>A final caution on translating English negations into Lojban: if you translate the English literally, you'll get the wrong one. With English causal statements, and other statements with auxiliary clauses, this problem is more likely.</para>
    <para>Thus, if you translate the English:</para>

    <para>you end up negating too much.</para>
    <para>Such mistranslations result from the ambiguity of English compounded by the messiness of natural language negation. A correct translation of the normal interpretation of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-hEa7"/> is:</para>

        <natlang>My not going to the market is because the car is broken.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-R3GU"/>, the negation is clearly confined to the event abstraction in the x1 sumti, and does not extend to the whole sentence. The English could also have been expressed by two separate sentences joined by a causal connective (which we'll not go into here).</para>
    
    <para>The problem is not confined to obvious causals. In the English:</para>

      <para>I was not conscripted into the Army with the help of my uncle the Senator.</para>
    </example>
    <para>we do not intend the uncle's help to be part of the negation. We must thus move the negation into an event clause or use two separate sentences. The event-clause version would look like:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-NILi">
      <title>

    </example>
    <para>It is possible that someone will want to incorporate bridi negations into lujvo. For this reason, the rafsi 
    <rafsi>-nar-</rafsi> has been reserved for 
    <valsi>na</valsi>. However, before using this rafsi, make sure that you intend the contradictory bridi negation, and not the scalar negation described in 
    <xref linkend="section-scalar-negation"/>, which will be much more common in tanru and lujvo.</para>

  <section xml:id="section-scalar-negation">

    <para>Let us now consider some other types of negation. For example, when we say:</para>

      </title>
      <para>The chair is not brown.</para>
    </example>
    <para>we make a positive inference &ndash; that the chair is some other color. Thus, it is legitimate to respond:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-DDN8">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d2"/>
      </title>
      <para>It is green.</para>
    </example>
    <para>Whether we agree that the chair is brown or not, the fact that the statement refers to color has significant effect on how we interpret some responses. If we hear the following exchange:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-muQB">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d3"/>
      </title>
      <para>The chair is not brown.</para>
      <para>Correct. The chair is wooden.</para>
    </example>
    <para>we immediately start to wonder about the unusual wood that isn't brown. If we hear the exchange:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-MxWM">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d4"/>
      </title>
      <para>Is the chair green?</para>
      <para>No, it is in the kitchen.</para>
    </example>
    <para>we are unsettled because the response seems to be a non-sequitur. But since it might be true and it is a statement about the chair, one can't say it is entirely irrelevant!</para>
    
    <para>What is going on in these statements is something called 
    <quote>scalar negation</quote>. As the name suggests, scalar negation presumes an implied scale. A negation of this type not only states that one scalar value is false, but implies that another value on the scale must be true. This can easily lead to complications. The following exchange seems reasonably natural (a little suspension of disbelief in such inane conversation will help):</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-s5DJ">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d5"/>
      </title>
      <para>That isn't a blue house.</para>
      <para>Right! That is a green house.</para>
    </example>
    <para>We have acknowledged a scalar negation by providing a correct value which is another color in the set of colors permissible for houses. While a little less likely, the following exchange is also natural:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-M472">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d6"/>
      </title>
      <para>That isn't a blue house.</para>
      <para>Right! That is a blue car.</para>
    </example>
    <para>Again, we have acknowledged a scalar negation, and substituted a different object in the universe of discourse of things that can be blue.</para>
    <para>Now, if the following exchange occurs:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-sq36">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d7"/>
      </title>
      <para>That isn't a blue house.</para>
      <para>Right! That is a green car.</para>
    </example>
    <para>we find the result unsettling. This is because it seems that two corrections have been applied when there is only one negation. Yet out of context, 
    <quote>blue house</quote> and 
    <quote>green car</quote> seem to be reasonably equivalent units that should be mutually replaceable in a sentence. It's just that we don't have a clear way in English to say:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-hd0I">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d8"/>
      </title>
      <para>That isn't a 
      <quote>blue-house</quote>.</para>
    </example>
    <para>aloud so as to clearly imply that the scalar negation is affecting the pair of words as a single unit.</para>
    <para>Another even more confusing example of scalar negation is to the sentence:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-JTrd">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d9"/>
      </title>
      <para>John didn't go to Paris from Rome.</para>
    </example>
    <para>Might 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-JTrd"/> imply that John went to Paris from somewhere else? Or did he go somewhere else from Rome? Or perhaps he didn't go anywhere at all: maybe someone else did, or maybe there was no event of going whatsoever. One can devise circumstances where any one, two or all three of these statements might be inferred by a listener.</para>
    <para>In English, we have a clear way of distinguishing scalar negation from predicate negation that can be used in many situations. We can use the partial word 
    <quote>non-</quote> as a prefix. But this is not always considered good usage, even though it would render many statements much clearer. For example, we can clearly distinguish</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-gN3C">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d10"/>
      </title>
      <para>That is a non-blue house.</para>
    </example>
    <para>from the related sentence</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-GtQC">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d11"/>
      </title>
      <para>That is a blue non-house.</para>
    </example>
    <para>
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-gN3C"/> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-GtQC"/> have the advantage that, while they contain a negative indication, they are in fact positive assertions. They say what is true by excluding the false; they do not say what is false.</para>
    <para>We can't always use 
    <quote>non-</quote> though, because of the peculiarities of English's grammar. It would sound strange to say:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-A3yR">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d12"/>
      </title>
      <para>John went to non-Paris from Rome.</para>
    </example>
    <para>or</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-sn2I">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d13"/>
      </title>
      <para>John went to Paris from non-Rome.</para>
    </example>
    <para>although these would clarify the vague negation. Another circumlocution for English scalar negation is 
    <quote>other than</quote>, which works where 
    <quote>non-</quote> does not, but is wordier.</para>
    <para>Finally, we have natural language negations that are called polar negations, or opposites:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qh2s">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d14"/>
      </title>
      <para>John is moral</para>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qh3s">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e3d15"/>
      </title>
      <para>John is immoral</para>
    </example>
    <para>To be immoral is much more than to just be not moral: it implies the opposite condition. Statements like 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qh3s"/> are strong negations which not only deny the truth of a statement, but assert its opposite. Since, 
    <quote>opposite</quote> implies a scale, polar negations are a special variety of scalar negations.</para>
    <para>To examine this concept more closely, let us draw a linear scale, showing two examples of how the scale is used:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
      Affirmations (positive)      Negations (negative)
      |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
      All       Most        Some         Few       None
      Excellent Good        Fair         Poor     Awful
    </programlisting>
    <para>Some scales are more binary than the examples we diagrammed. Thus we have 
    <quote>not necessary</quote> or 
    <quote>unnecessary</quote> being the polar opposite of necessary. Another scale, especially relevant to Lojban, is interpreted based on situations modified by one's philosophy: 
    <quote>not true</quote> may be equated with 
    <quote>false</quote> in a bi-valued truth-functional logic, while in tri-valued logic an intermediate between 
    <quote>true</quote> and 
    <quote>false</quote> is permitted, and in fuzzy logic a continuous scale exists from true to false. The meaning of 
    
    <quote>not true</quote> requires a knowledge of which variety of truth scale is being considered.</para>
    <para>We will define the most general form of scalar negation as indicating only that the particular point or value in the scale or range is not valid and that some other (unspecified) point on the scale is correct. This is the intent expressed in most contexts by 
    <quote>not mild</quote>, for example.</para>
    <para>Using this paradigm, contradictory negation is less restrictive than scalar negation &ndash; it says that the point or value stated is incorrect (false), and makes no statement about the truth of any other point or value, whether or not on the scale.</para>
    <para>In English, scalar negation semantically includes phrases such as 
    <quote>other than</quote>, 
    <quote>reverse of</quote>, or 
    <quote>opposite from</quote> expressions and their equivalents. More commonly, scalar negation is expressed in English by the prefixes 
    <quote>non-</quote>, 
    <quote>un-</quote>, 
    <quote>il-</quote>, and 
    <quote>im-</quote>. Just which form and permissible values are implied by a scalar negation is dependent on the semantics of the word or concept which is being negated, and on the context. Much confusion in English results from the uncontrolled variations in meaning of these phrases and prefixes.</para>
    <para>In the examples of 
    <xref linkend="section-nahe"/>, we will translate the general case of scalar negation using the general formula 
    <quote>other than</quote> when a phrase is scalar-negated, and 
    <quote>non-</quote> when a single word is scalar-negated.</para>

    <title>selbri and tanru negation</title>
    <para>All the scalar negations illustrated in 
    <xref linkend="section-scalar-negation"/> are expressed in Lojban using the cmavo 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> (of selma'o NAhE). The most common use of 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> is as a prefix to the selbri:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qh42" role="interlinear-gloss-example">
      <title>

        <gloss>I non-go to the market.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Comparing these two, we see that the negation operator being used in 
    
    
    
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qH4n"/> is 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi>. But what exactly does 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> negate? Does the negation include only the gismu 
    <valsi>klama</valsi>, which is the entire selbri in this case, or does it include the 
    <jbophrase>le zarci</jbophrase> as well? In Lojban, the answer is unambiguously 
    <quote>only the gismu</quote>. The cmavo 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> always applies only to what follows it.</para>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qH4n"/> looks as if it were parallel to:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-tqX1">

        <gloss>I [false] go-to the market.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation using 
    <valsi>na</valsi> denies the truth of a relationship, but a selbri negation with 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> asserts that a relationship exists other than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti identified in the statement. The grammar allotted to 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> allows us to unambiguously express scalar negations in terms of scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> is determined.</para>
    <para>In tanru, we may wish to negate an individual element before combining it with another to form the tanru. We in effect need a shorter-than-selbri-scope negation, for which we can use 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> as well. The positive sentence</para>

    </example>
    <para>These negations show the default scope of 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> is close-binding on an individual brivla in a tanru. 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qh4w"/> says that I am going to the market, but in some kind of a non-walking manner. (As with most tanru, there are a few other possible interpretations, but we'll assume this one &ndash; see 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/> for a discussion of tanru meaning).</para>
    <para>In neither 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qh4w"/> nor 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qH6w"/> does the 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> negate the entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations that deny a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a component which makes a positive claim about such a relationship. This is clearer in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qh4w"/>, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking manner. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qH6w"/>, we have claimed that the relationship between me and the market in some way involves walking, but is not one of 
    <quote>going to</quote> (perhaps we are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the market).</para>
    <para>The 
    <quote>scale</quote>, or actually the 
    <quote>set</quote>, implied in Lojban tanru negations is anything which plausibly can be substituted into the tanru. (Plausibility here is interpreted in the same way that answers to a 
    <valsi>mo</valsi> question must be plausible &ndash; the result must not only have the right number of places and have sumti values appropriate to the place structure, it must also be appropriate or relevant to the context.) This minimal condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who uses selbri negation is denying one relationship, while minimally asserting a different relationship.</para>
    <para>We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer than a single brivla. There exists such a longer-scope selbri negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban sentence in the next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the second copy showing the scope of the 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi>):</para>

        <gloss>I other-than-(walkingly-go-to) the market.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>This negation uses the same

    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> delimiters (the 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> is always elidable at the end of a selbri) that are used in tanru. The sentence clearly negates the entire selbri. The 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi>, whether elided or not, reminds us that the negation does not include the trailing sumti. While the trailing-sumti place-structure is defined as that of the final brivla, the trailing sumti themselves are not part of the selbri and are thus not negated by 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi>.</para>
    <para>Negations of just part of the selbri are also permitted:</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qh7T"/> is more restricted in scope; i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1 ( 
    <valsi>mi</valsi>).</para>
    <para>Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban's claims to be unambiguous, let us indicate the relative precedence of 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> as an operator. Grouping with 
    <valsi>ke</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi>, of course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> is very close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru, with 
    <valsi>bo</valsi>, is not as tightly bound as 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi>. 
    <valsi>co</valsi>, the tanru inversion operator has a scope that is longer than all other tanru constructs.</para>
    
    <para>In short, 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> and 
    <jbophrase>na'eke</jbophrase> define a type of negation, which is shorter in scope than bridi negation, and which affects all or part of a selbri. The result of 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not merely a denial of another claim.</para>
    <para>The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the rafsi 
    <rafsi>-nal-</rafsi>, representing 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> when a tanru is condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel to the English usage of 
    <jbophrase>non-</jbophrase>. Turning a series of related negations into lujvo gives:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note: 
    <rafsi>-kem-</rafsi> is the rafsi for 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>, but it is omitted in the final lujvo as superfluous &ndash; 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> is its own rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a 
    
    <valsi>ke</valsi> after the 
    <rafsi>-nal-</rafsi>, since it needs to close something; only a 
    <valsi>ke</valsi> immediately after the negation would make the 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> meaningful in the tanru expressed in this lujvo.</para>
    <para>In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate 
    <rafsi>-nal-</rafsi> as 
    <quote>non-</quote>, to match the English combining forms, except when the 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> has single word scope and English uses 
    <quote>un-</quote> or 
    <quote>im-</quote> to negate that single word. Translation style should determine the use of 
    <quote>other than</quote>, 
    <quote>non-</quote>, or another negator for 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> in tanru; the translator must render the Lojban into English so it is clear in context. Let's go back to our simplest example:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note that to compare with the English translation form using 
    <quote>non-</quote>, we've translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a noun. Since Lojban 
    <valsi>klama</valsi> is indifferently a noun, verb, or adjective, the difference is purely a translation change, not a true change in meaning. The English difference seems significant, though, due to the strongly different English grammatical forms and the ambiguity of English negation.</para>

    <valsi>na'e</valsi> to the brivla. The lujvo form makes this overt by absorbing the negative marker into the word.</para>
    
    
    
    
    
    <para>Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say that he is bald, or non-bald, or to make any other affirmative claim about him. Any sentence about the current King of France containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any effect on the truth value of the sentence, which is invariably 
    <quote>false</quote>, since no affirmative statement about the current King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation does produce a truth:</para>

    <para>Note: 
    <valsi>lo</valsi> is used in these sentences because negation relates to truth conditions. To meaningfully talk about truth conditions in sentences carrying a description, it must be clear that the description actually applies to the referent. A sentence using

    <valsi>lo</valsi> can be true even if there is no current king of France, as long as the speaker and the listener agree to describe something as the current king of France. (See the explanations of

    </example>
    <para>We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making the two trailing sumti values explicit (the 
    <quote>as perceived by</quote> and 
    <quote>under conditions</quote> places have been added to the place structure of 
    <valsi>xunre</valsi>). But assume we have a really stubborn listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will find a way to misinterpret

    <para>In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita

  <section xml:id="section-sumti-negation">
    <title>sumti negation</title>
    <para>There are two ways of negating sumti in Lojban. We have the choice of quantifying the sumti with zero, or of applying the sumti-negator 
    <jbophrase>na'ebo</jbophrase> before the sumti. It turns out that a zero quantification serves for contradictory negation. As the cmavo we use implies, 
    
    <jbophrase>na'ebo</jbophrase> forms a scalar negation.</para>
    
    <para>Let us show examples of each.</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-PL1E">
      <title>

        <gloss>Zero of those who are currently noblest-governors of the French country are-hair-without.</gloss>
        <natlang>No current king of France is bald.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Is 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-PL1E"/> true? Yes, because it merely claims that of the current Kings of France, however many there may be, none are bald, which is plainly true, since there are no such current Kings of France.</para>
    <para>Now let us look at the same sentence using 
    <jbophrase>na'ebo</jbophrase> negation:</para>
    
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-LebJ">

        <natlang>Something other than the current King of France is bald.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-LebJ"/> is true provided that something reasonably describable as 
    <quote>other than a current King of France</quote>, such as the King of Saudi Arabia, or a former King of France, is in fact bald.</para>
    <para>In place of 
    <jbophrase>na'ebo</jbophrase>, you may also use 
    
    <jbophrase>no'ebo</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>to'ebo</jbophrase>, to be more specific about the sumti which would be appropriate in place of the stated sumti. Good examples are hard to come by, but here's a valiant try:</para>

    </example>
    <para>(Boston and Perth are nearly, but not quite, antipodal cities. In a purely United States context, San Francisco might be a better 
    <quote>opposite</quote>.) Coming up with good examples is difficult, because attaching 
    <jbophrase>to'ebo</jbophrase> to a description sumti is usually the same as attaching 
    <valsi>to'e</valsi> to the selbri of the description.</para>
    <para>It is not possible to transform sumti negations of either type into bridi negations or scalar selbri negations. Negations of sumti will be used in Lojban conversation. The inability to manipulate these negations logically will, it is hoped, prevent the logical errors that result when natural languages attempt corresponding manipulations.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-other-negation">
    <title>Negation of minor grammatical constructs</title>
    <para>We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we use the suffix-combining negator, which is 
    <valsi>nai</valsi>. 
    <valsi>nai</valsi>, by the way, is almost always written as a compound into the previous word that it is negating, although it is a regular separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.</para>
    <para>Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of the particular construct being negated. Thus, we will not go into much detail here.</para>
    <para>The following are places where 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> is used:</para>
    <para>When attached to tenses and modals (see 
      <xref linkend="section-modal-negation"/>, <xref linkend="section-interval-properties"/>, <xref linkend="section-tense-negation"/> and <xref linkend="section-connected-tenses"/>), the
    <valsi>nai</valsi> suffix usually indicates a contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus 
    <jbophrase>punai</jbophrase> as a tense inflection means 
    <quote>not-in-the-past</quote>, or 
    <quote>not-previously</quote>, without making any implication about any other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>mean exactly the same thing, although there may be a difference of emphasis.</para>
    <para>Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the logical connectives containing contradictory negations; this allows negated tenses and modals to be expressed positively using logical connectives. Thus 
    <jbophrase>punai je ca</jbophrase> means the same thing as 
    <jbophrase>pu naje ca</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para>As a special case, a 
    <jbophrase>-nai</jbophrase> attached to the interval modifiers of selma'o TAhE, ROI, or ZAhO (explained in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tenses"/>) signals a scalar negation:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-4YYQ">

        <gloss>I [once] [not] dance-on the ice</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more times within the relevant time interval described by the bridi. 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-4YYQ"/> is very different from the English use of 
    <quote>not once</quote>, which is an emphatic way of saying 
    <quote>never</quote> &ndash; that is, exactly zero times.</para>
    <para>In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> denotes a polar negation. As discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-intensity-scale"/>, most indicators have an implicit scale, and 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> changes the indicator to refer to the opposite end of the scale. Thus 
    <valsi>.uinai</valsi> expresses unhappiness, and 
    <valsi>.ienai</valsi> expresses disagreement (not ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided intensity as 
    <jbophrase>.iecu'i</jbophrase>).</para>
    <para>Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of indicator, but one which identifies the listener. Semantically, we could dispense with about half of the COI selma'o words based on the scalar paradigm. For example, 
    
    
    <valsi>co'o</valsi> could be expressed as 
    <jbophrase>coinai</jbophrase>. However, this is not generally done.</para>
    <para>Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called protocol situations. These protocols are used, for example, in radio conversations, which often take place in a noisy environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey diametrically opposite communications situations (as might be expected). Therefore, only one protocol vocative is dependent on 
    
    <valsi>nai</valsi>: negative acknowledgement, which is 
    <valsi>je'enai</valsi> ( 
    <quote>I didn't get that</quote>).</para>
    <para>Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be unimportant in noisy situations, the protocol vocatives become more important. So if, in a noisy environment, a protocol listener makes out only 
    
    
    <valsi>nai</valsi>, he or she can presume it is a negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise respond accordingly. 
    <xref linkend="section-vocative-scales"/> provides more detail on this topic.</para>
    <para>The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the tenses and modals. NU allows negative abstractions, especially in compound abstractions connected by logical connectives: 
    <jbophrase>su'ujeninai</jbophrase>, which corresponds to 
    <jbophrase>su'u jenai ni</jbophrase> just as 
    <jbophrase>punai je ca</jbophrase> corresponds to 
    <jbophrase>pu naje ca</jbophrase>. It is not clear how much use logically connected abstractors will be: see 
    <xref linkend="section-abstractor-connection"/>.</para>
    <para>A 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o JOI or BIhI) is a scalar negation, and says that the bridi is false under the specified mixture, but that another connective is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-non-logical-connectives"/>.</para>

    <para>as a response to a negative question like 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-8VCt"/>, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Pgrw"/> create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new 
    <valsi>na</valsi> to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the 
    <valsi>na</valsi> replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?</para>
    <para>It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations.

  <section xml:id="section-metalinguistic-negation">
    <title>Metalinguistic negation forms</title>
    <para>The question of truth or falsity is not entirely synonymous with negation. Consider the English sentence</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-QsJ9">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c15e10d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>I have not stopped beating my wife.</para>
    </example>
    <para>If I never started such a heinous activity, then this sentence is neither true nor false. Such a negation simply says that something is wrong with the non-negated statement. Generally, we then use either tone of voice or else a correction to express a preferred true claim: 
    
    <quote>I never have beaten my wife.</quote></para>
    <para>Negations which follow such a pattern are called 
    <quote>metalinguistic negations</quote>. In natural languages, the mark of metalinguistic negation is that an indication of a correct statement always, or almost always, follows the negation. Tone of voice or emphasis may be further used to clarify the error.</para>
    <para>Negations of every sort must be expressible in Lojban; errors are inherent to human thought, and are not excluded from the language. When such negations are metalinguistic, we must separate them from logical claims about the truth or falsity of the statement, as well as from scalar negations which may not easily express (or imply) the preferred claim. Because Lojban allows concepts to be so freely combined in tanru, limits on what is plausible or not plausible tend to be harder to determine.</para>
    <para>Mimicking the muddled nature of natural language negation would destroy this separation. Since Lojban does not use tone of voice, we need other means to metalinguistically indicate what is wrong with a statement. When the statement is entirely inappropriate, we need to be able to express metalinguistic negation in a more non-specific fashion.</para>

      <para>Not only was it a sheep, it was a black sheep.</para>
      <para>(non-contradictory correction)</para>
    </example>
    <para>The set of possible metalinguistic errors is open-ended.</para>
    <para>Many of these forms have a counterpart in the various examples that we've discussed under logical negation. Metalinguistic negation doesn't claim that the sentence is false or true, though. Rather, it claims that, due to some error in the statement, 
    <quote>true</quote> and 
    <quote>false</quote> don't really apply.</para>
    <para>Because one can metalinguistically negate a true statement intending a non-contradictory correction (say, a spelling error); we need a way (or ways) to metalinguistically negate a statement which is independent of our logical negation schemes using 
    <valsi>na</valsi>, 
    <valsi>na'e</valsi> and kin. The cmavo 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> is assigned this function. If it is present in a statement, it indicates metalinguistically that something in the statement is incorrect. This metalinguistic negation must override any evaluation of the logic of the statement. It is equally allowed in both positive and negative statements.</para>
    <para>Since 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> is not a logical operator, multiple occurrences of 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> need not be assumed to cancel each other. Indeed, we can use the position of 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> to indicate metalinguistically what is incorrect, preparatory to correcting it in a later sentence; for this reason, we give 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> the grammar of UI. The inclusion of 
    
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> anywhere in a sentence makes it a non-assertion, and suggests one or more pitfalls in assigning a truth value.</para>
    <para>Let us briefly indicate how the above-mentioned metalinguistic errors can be identified. Other metalinguistic problems can then be marked by devising analogies to these examples:</para>
    <para>Existential failure can be marked by attaching 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> to the descriptor 
    <valsi>lo</valsi> or the 
    <valsi>poi</valsi> in a 
    <jbophrase>da poi</jbophrase>-form sumti. (See
    <xref linkend="section-basic-descriptors"/> and 
    <xref linkend="section-restricted-claims"/> for details on these constructions.) Remember that if a 
    <valsi>le</valsi> sumti seems to refer to a non-existent referent, you may not understand what the speaker has in mind &ndash; the appropriate response is then 
    <valsi>ki'a</valsi>, asking for clarification.</para>
    <para>Presupposition failure can be marked directly if the presupposition is overt; if not, one can insert a 
    <quote>mock presupposition</quote> to question with the sumti tcita (selma'o BAI) word 
    <valsi>ji'u</valsi>; 
    <jbophrase>ji'uku</jbophrase> thus explicitly refers to an unexpressed assumption, and 
    <jbophrase>ji'una'iku</jbophrase> metalinguistically says that something is wrong with that assumption. (See 
    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti-tcita"/>.)</para>
    <para>Scale errors and category errors can be similarly expressed with selma'o BAI. 
    <valsi>le'a</valsi> has meaning 
    <quote>of category/class/type X</quote>, 
    <valsi>ci'u</valsi> has meaning 
    
    <quote>on scale X</quote>, and 
    <valsi>ci'e</valsi>, based on 
    <valsi>ciste</valsi>, can be used to talk about universes of discourse defined either as systems or sets of components, as shown in 
    <xref linkend="section-truth-questions"/>. 
    <valsi>kai</valsi> and 
    <valsi>la'u</valsi> also exist in BAI for discussing other quality and quantity errors.</para>
    
    <para>We have to make particular note of potential problems in the areas of undue quantity and incorrect scale/category. Assertions about the relationships between gismu are among the basic substance of the language. It is thus invalid to logically require that if something is blue, that it is colored, or if it is not-blue, then it is some other color. In Lojban, 
    <valsi>blanu</valsi> ( 
    <quote>blue</quote>) is not explicitly defined as a 
    <valsi>skari</valsi> ( 
    <quote>color</quote>). Similarly, it is not implicit that the opposite of 
    <quote>good</quote> is 
    <quote>bad</quote>.</para>
    <para>This mutual independence of gismu is only an ideal. Pragmatically, people will categorize things based on their world-views. We will write dictionary definitions that will relate gismu, unfortunately including some of these world-view assumptions. Lojbanists should try to minimize these assumptions, but this seems a likely area where logical rules will break down (or where Sapir-Whorf effects will be made evident). In terms of negation, however, it is vital that we clearly preserve the capability of denying a presumably obvious scale or category assumption.</para>
    
    <para>Solecisms, grammatical and spelling errors will be marked by marking the offending word or phrase with 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> (in the manner of any selma'o UI cmavo). In this sense, 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> becomes equivalent to the English metalinguistic marker 
    <quote>[sic]</quote>. Purists may choose to use ZOI or LOhU/LEhU quotes or 
    <valsi>sa'a</valsi>-marked corrections to avoid repeating a truly unparsable passage, especially if a computer is to analyze the speech/text. See 
    
    <xref linkend="section-parentheses"/> for explanations of these usages.</para>
    <para>In summary, metalinguistic negation will typically take the form of referring to a previous statement and marking it with one or more 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> to indicate what metalinguistic errors have been made, and then repeating the statement with corrections. References to previous statements may be full repetitions, or may use members of selma'o GOhA. 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> at the beginning of a statement merely says that something is inappropriate about the statement, without specificity.</para>
    
    <para>In normal use, metalinguistic negation requires that a corrected statement follow the negated statement. In Lojban, however, it is possible to completely and unambiguously specify metalinguistic errors without correcting them. It will eventually be seen whether an uncorrected metalinguistic negation remains an acceptable form in Lojban. In such a statement, metalinguistic expression would involve an ellipsis not unlike that of tenseless expression.</para>
    
    <para>Note that metalinguistic negation gives us another kind of legitimate negative answer to a 
    
    <valsi>xu</valsi> question (see 
    <xref linkend="section-truth-questions"/>). 
    <valsi>na'i</valsi> will be used when something about the questioned statement is inappropriate, such as in questions like 
    <quote>Have you stopped beating your wife?</quote>:</para>

    <para>One can also specifically qualify the metalinguistic negation, by explicitly repeating the erroneous portion of the bridi to be metalinguistically negated, or adding on of the selma'o BAI qualifiers mentioned above:</para>

    <para>Finally, one may metalinguistically affirm a bridi with

    <valsi>jo'a</valsi> might be to affirm that a particular construction, though unusual or counterintuitive, is in fact correct; another usage would be to disagree with &ndash; by overriding &ndash; a respondent's metalinguistic negation.</para>

    <quote>Nobody</quote> were really a name, since the Messenger could only pass someone who does walk more slowly than he. But the Messenger interprets the word

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-105i"/>) 
    <quote>... nobody walks much faster than I do</quote> (i.e., I walk faster, or as fast as, almost everyone), which the King then again misunderstands. Both the King and the Messenger are correct according to their respective understandings of the ambiguous word

    <para>A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this chapter, we will make use of the logical connectives

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular, one may place 
    
    <valsi>na</valsi> before 
    <valsi>e</valsi> or 
    <valsi>a</valsi>, or between 
    <valsi>i</valsi> and 
    <valsi>je</valsi> or 
    <valsi>ja</valsi>; likewise, one may place 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> at the end of a connective. Both 
    <valsi>na</valsi> and 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> have negative effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically, 
    <valsi>na</valsi> negates the first or left-hand sumti or bridi, and 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> negates the second or right-hand one.</para>
    <para>Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that sentence can be expanded into two sentences by repeating the common terms and joining the sentences by a logical connective beginning with 
    <valsi>i</valsi>. Thus the following sentence:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-jmDS">

        <natlang>I come here, and, you come here.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical connective, with any valid combination of 
    <valsi>na</valsi> or 
    <valsi>nai</valsi> attached. No change in meaning occurs under such a transformation.</para>
    <para>Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded sentence forms, then we know what it means in all of the other forms. But what does negation mean between sentences?</para>

    <jbophrase>re da</jbophrase> appears later, it refers to two of those three things &ndash; there is no saying which ones. Further uses of 
    <valsi>da</valsi> alone, if there were any, would refer once more to the three cats, so the requantification of

There are many more aspects of logic that I neither fully understand nor feel competent to explain, neither in abstract nor in their Lojban realization. Lojban was designed to be a language that makes predicate logic speakable, and achieving that goal completely will need to wait for someone who understands both logic and Lojban better than I do.

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lerfu</primary><secondary>definition</secondary></indexterm> (Don't forget the one within quotation marks.) Using the word 
    <quote>letteral</quote> avoids confusion with 
    <quote>letter</quote>, the kind you write to someone. Not surprisingly, there is a Lojban gismu for 
    <quote>letteral</quote>, namely 
    <valsi>lerfu</valsi>, and this word will be used in the rest of this chapter.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>alphabet</primary><secondary>Latin used for Lojban</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Latin</primary><secondary>alphabet of Lojban</secondary></indexterm> Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, just as English does, right? Then why is there a need for a chapter like this? After all, everyone who can read it already knows the alphabet. The answer is twofold:</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>alphabet</primary><secondary>words for letters in</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> First, in English there are a set of words that correspond to and represent the English lerfu. These words are rarely written down in English and have no standard spellings, but if you pronounce the English alphabet to yourself you will hear them: ay, bee, cee, dee ... . They are used in spelling out words and in pronouncing most acronyms. The Lojban equivalents of these words are standardized and must be documented somehow.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>alphabets</primary><secondary>words for non-Lojban letters</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> Second, English has names only for the lerfu used in writing English. (There are also English names for Greek and Hebrew lerfu: English-speakers usually refer to the Greek lerfu conventionally spelled 
    <quote>phi</quote> as 
    <quote>fye</quote>, whereas 
    <quote>fee</quote> would more nearly represent the name used by Greek-speakers. Still, not all English-speakers know these English names.) Lojban, in order to be culturally neutral, needs a more comprehensive system that can handle, at least potentially, all of the world's alphabets and other writing systems.</para>
    <para>Letterals have several uses in Lojban: in forming acronyms and abbreviations, as mathematical symbols, and as pro-sumti &ndash; the equivalent of English pronouns.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>letter</primary><secondary>contrasted with word for the letter</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lerfu word</primary><secondary>contrasted with lerfu</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>lerfu</primary><secondary>contrasted with lerfu word</secondary></indexterm> In earlier writings about Lojban, there has been a tendency to use the word 
    <valsi>lerfu</valsi> for both the letterals themselves and for the Lojban words which represent them. In this chapter, that tendency will be ruthlessly suppressed, and the term 
    <quote>lerfu word</quote> will invariably be used for the latter. The Lojban equivalent would be 
    <jbophrase>lerfu valsi</jbophrase> or 
    <valsi>lervla</valsi>.</para>

The lerfu words for English are a motley crew: the relationship between 
    <quote>doubleyou</quote> and 
    <quote>w</quote> is strictly historical in nature; 
    <quote>aitch</quote> represents 
    <quote>h</quote> but has no clear relationship to it at all; and 
    <quote>z</quote> has two distinct lerfu words, 
    <quote>zee</quote> and

The consonant lerfu words are a single syllable, whereas the vowel and 
    <letteral>'</letteral> lerfu words are two syllables and must be preceded by pause (since they all begin with a vowel). Another fact, not evident from the table but important nonetheless, is that 
    <valsi>by</valsi> and its like are single cmavo of selma'o BY, as is 
    <valsi>.y'y</valsi>. The vowel lerfu words, on the other hand, are compound cmavo, made from a single vowel cmavo plus the cmavo 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> (which belongs to its own selma'o, BU). All of the vowel cmavo have other meanings in Lojban (logical connectives, sentence separator, hesitation noise), but those meanings are irrelevant when

The English words 
    <quote>fail</quote> and 
    <quote>vale</quote> sound similar, but just hearing the first lerfu word of either, namely 
    <quote>eff</quote> or 
    <quote>vee</quote>, is enough to discriminate easily between them &ndash; and even if the first lerfu word were somehow confused, neither 
    <quote>vail</quote> nor 
    <quote>fale</quote> is a word of ordinary English, so the rest of the spelling determines which word is meant. Still, the capability of spelling out words does exist in Lojban.</para>

    <para>As stated in 
    <xref linkend="section-letterals-introduction"/>, Lojban's goal of cultural neutrality demands a standard set of lerfu words for the lerfu of as many other writing systems as possible. When we meet these lerfu in written text (particularly, though not exclusively, mathematical text), we need a standard Lojbanic way to pronounce them.</para>
    <para>There are certainly hundreds of alphabets and other writing systems in use around the world, and it is probably an unachievable goal to create a single system which can express all of them, but if perfection is not demanded, a usable system can be created from the raw material which Lojban provides.</para>

  <indexterm type="general"><primary>alpha</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
  <indexterm type="general"><primary>letters</primary><secondary>non-Lojban</secondary><tertiary>representation with names</tertiary></indexterm> One possibility would be to use the lerfu word associated with the language itself, Lojbanized and with 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> added. Indeed, an isolated Greek 
    <quote>alpha</quote> in running Lojban text is probably most easily handled by calling it 
    
    <jbophrase>.alfas. bu</jbophrase>. Here the Greek lerfu word has been made into a Lojbanized name by adding 
    <letteral>s</letteral> and then into a Lojban lerfu word by adding 
    <valsi>bu</valsi>. Note that the pause after

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>letters</primary><secondary>non-Lojban</secondary><tertiary>representation with consonant-word + bu</tertiary></indexterm> Likewise, the easiest way to handle the Latin letters 
    <quote>h</quote>, 
    <quote>q</quote>, and 
    <quote>w</quote> that are not used in Lojban is by a consonant lerfu word with 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> attached. The following assignments have been made:</para>

    <para>However, this system is not ideal for all purposes. For one thing, it is verbose. The native lerfu words are often quite long, and with 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> added they become even longer: the worst-case Greek lerfu word would be 
    <jbophrase>.Omikron. bu</jbophrase>, with four syllables and two mandatory pauses. In addition, alphabets that are used by many languages have separate sets of lerfu words for each language, and which set is Lojban to choose?</para>

    <xref linkend="section-upper-case"/>. After the appearance of such a shift word, the regular lerfu words are re-interpreted to represent the lerfu of the alphabet now in use. After a shift to the Greek alphabet, for example, the lerfu word 
    
    <valsi>ty</valsi> would represent not Latin 
    <quote>t</quote> but Greek 
    <quote>tau</quote>. Why 
    <quote>tau</quote>? Because it is, in some sense, the closest counterpart of 
    <quote>t</quote> within the Greek lerfu system. In principle it would be all right to map 
    <valsi>ty.</valsi> to 
    <quote>phi</quote> or even 
    <quote>omega</quote>, but such an arbitrary relationship would be extremely hard to remember.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>bu</primary><secondary>interaction with language shift</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>language shift</primary><secondary>interaction with bu</secondary></indexterm> Where no obvious closest counterpart exists, some more or less arbitrary choice must be made. Some alien lerfu may simply not have any shifted equivalent, forcing the speaker to fall back on a 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> form. Since a 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> form may mean different things in different alphabets, it is safest to employ a shift word even when 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> forms are in use.</para>

French, for example, uses three accent marks above vowels, called (in English) 
    
    
    <quote>acute</quote>, 
    <quote>grave</quote>, and 
    <quote>circumflex</quote>. Likewise, German uses a mark called

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>diacritical marks</primary><secondary>problem of position</secondary></indexterm> These marks may be considered lerfu, and each has a corresponding lerfu word in Lojban. So far, no problem. But the marks appear over lerfu, whereas the words must be spoken (or written) either before or after the lerfu word representing the basic lerfu. Typewriters (for mechanical reasons) and the computer programs that emulate them usually require their users to type the accent mark before the basic lerfu, whereas in speech the accent mark is often pronounced afterwards (for example, in German 
    
    <quote>a umlaut</quote> is preferred to

    <valsi>tei</valsi> (of selma'o TEI) and 
    <valsi>foi</valsi> (of selma'o FOI) must be used. These cmavo are always used in pairs; any number of lerfu words may appear between them, and the whole is treated as a single compound lerfu word. The French word

    <quote xml:lang="es">ll</quote> and

    <valsi>lau</valsi> must always be followed by a BY word; the interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a name or brivla with a

    <valsi>bu</valsi> mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it is easy for Lojban users to make up 
    <valsi>bu</valsi> words without bothering to explain what they mean. Using the 
    <valsi>lau</valsi> cmavo flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same argument applies to the use of 
    
    <valsi>zai</valsi> to signal an alphabet shift or

For precisely specifying a particular character, however, it has the advantages of unambiguity and (relative) cultural neutrality, and therefore Lojban provides a means for those with access to descriptions of such character sets to take advantage of them.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>lerfu words</primary><secondary>list of proposed</secondary><tertiary>notation convention</tertiary></indexterm> The following sections contain tables of proposed lerfu words for some of the standard alphabets supported by the Lojban lerfu system. The first column of each list is the lerfu (actually, a Latin-alphabet name sufficient to identify it). The second column is the proposed name-based lerfu word, and the third column is the proposed lerfu word in the system based on using the cmavo of selma'o BY with a shift word.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>proposed lerfu words</primary><secondary>as working basis</secondary></indexterm> These tables are not meant to be authoritative (several authorities within the Lojban community have niggled over them extensively, disagreeing with each other and sometimes with themselves). They provide a working basis until actual usage is available, rather than a final resolution of lerfu word problems. Probably the system presented here will evolve somewhat before settling down into a final, conventional form.</para>

    <para>lojbau mekso ( 
    <quote>Lojbanic mathematical-expression</quote>) is the part of the Lojban language that is tailored for expressing statements of a mathematical character, or for adding numerical information to non-mathematical statements. Its formal design goals include:</para>

The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say 
    <jbophrase>li ci su'i vo pi'i mu</jbophrase> and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics.

Essentially because there are too many operators, known and unknown, with levels of precedence that vary according to usage. The programming language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of operators is not even extensible. For Lojban this approach is just not practical. In addition, hard-wired precedence could not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets where the conventions are different.)</para>

    <para>The infix form explained so far is reasonable for many purposes, but it is limited and rigid. It works smoothly only where all operators have exactly two operands, and where precedences can either be assumed from context or are limited to just two levels, with some help from parentheses.</para>
    <para>But there are many operators which do not have two operands, or which have a variable number of operands. The preferred form of expression in such cases is the use of 
    <quote>forethought operators</quote>, also known as Polish notation. In this style of writing mathematics, the operator comes first and the operands afterwards:</para>

        <math>sum(1,2,3) = 6</math>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note that the normally elidable number terminator 
    <valsi>boi</valsi> is required after 
    <valsi>pa</valsi> and 
    <valsi>re</valsi> because otherwise the reading would be 
    <jbophrase>pareci</jbophrase>= 123. It is not required after 
    <valsi>ci</valsi> but is inserted here in brackets for the sake of symmetry. The only time 
    <valsi>boi</valsi> is required is, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-I0Bm"/>, when there are two consecutive numbers or lerfu strings.</para>
    <para>Forethought mekso can use any number of operands, in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-I0Bm"/>, three. How do we know how many operands there are in ambiguous circumstances? The usual Lojban solution is employed: an elidable terminator, namely 
    <valsi>ku'e</valsi>. Here is an example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-IxMG">

        <gloss>The-number 
        <quote>p</quote> plus negative-of( 
        <quote>n</quote>) plus 
        <quote>z</quote> equals the-number 
        <quote>x</quote>.</gloss>
        <math>p + -n + z = x</math>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>where we know that 
    <valsi>va'a</valsi> is a forethought operator because there is no operand preceding it.</para>
    <para>
      <valsi>va'a</valsi> is the numerical negation operator, of selma'o VUhU. In contrast, 
      
      
      
      
      <valsi>vu'u</valsi> is not used for numerical negation, but only for subtraction, as it always has two or more operands. Do not confuse 
      <valsi>va'a</valsi> and 
      <valsi>vu'u</valsi>, which are operators, with 
    <valsi>ni'u</valsi>, which is part of a number.</para>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-IxMG"/>, the operator 
    <valsi>va'a</valsi> and the terminator 
    <valsi>ku'e</valsi> serve in effect as parentheses. (The regular parentheses 
    <valsi>vei</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ve'o</valsi> are NOT used for this purpose.) If the 
    <valsi>ku'e</valsi> were omitted, the 
    <jbophrase>su'i zy</jbophrase> would be swallowed up by the 
    <valsi>va'a</valsi> forethought operator, which would then appear to have two operands, 
    <valsi>ny</valsi> and 
    <jbophrase>su'i zy.</jbophrase>, where the latter is also a forethought expression.</para>
    <para>Forethought mekso is also useful for matching standard functional notation. How do we represent 
    
    <quote>z = f(x)</quote>? The answer is:</para>
    
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-VybU">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c18e6d3"/>
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>li zy du li ma'o fy.boi xy.</jbo>
        <gloss>The-number z equals the-number the-operator f x.</gloss>
        <math>z = f(x)</math>
        
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Again, no parentheses are used. The construct 
    <jbophrase>ma'o fy.boi</jbophrase> is the equivalent of an operator, and appears in forethought here (although it could also be used as a regular infix operator). In mathematics, letters sometimes mean functions and sometimes mean variables, with only the context to tell which. Lojban chooses to accept the variable interpretation as the default, and uses the special flag 
    <valsi>ma'o</valsi> to mark a lerfu string as an operator. The cmavo 
    <valsi>xy.</valsi> and 
    <valsi>zy.</valsi> are variables, but 
    <valsi>fy.</valsi> is an operator (a function) because 
    <valsi>ma'o</valsi> marks it as such. The 
    <valsi>boi</valsi> is required because otherwise the 
    <valsi>xy.</valsi> would look like part of the operator name. (The use of 
    <valsi>ma'o</valsi> can be generalized from lerfu strings to any mekso operand: see 
    <xref linkend="section-miscellany"/>.)</para>
    <para>When using forethought mekso, the optional marker 
    <valsi>pe'o</valsi> may be placed in front of the operator. This usage can help avoid confusion by providing clearly marked 
    
    <valsi>pe'o</valsi> and 
    
    <valsi>ku'e</valsi> pairs to delimit the operand list. 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-I0Bm"/> to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-VybU"/>, respectively, with explicit 
    <valsi>pe'o</valsi> and 
    
    <valsi>ku'e</valsi>:</para>

    <para>Note: When using forethought mekso, be sure that the operands really are operands: they cannot contain regular infix expressions unless parenthesized with 
    
    <valsi>vei</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ve'o</valsi>. An earlier version of the complex 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-k36J"/> came to grief because I forgot this rule.</para>

    <para>The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between 
    
    <valsi>ro</valsi> and 
    <valsi>no</valsi>, with a built-in ordering. In particular, 
    <valsi>so'e</valsi> does not mean 
    
    <quote>most</quote> in the sense of 
    <quote>a majority</quote> or 
    <quote>more than half</quote>.</para>
    <para>Each of these numbers, plus 
    <valsi>ro</valsi>, may be prefixed with 
    <valsi>pi</valsi> (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. 
    
    <valsi>piro</valsi> therefore means 
    <quote>the whole of</quote>:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Similarly, 
    <valsi>piso'a</valsi> means 
    <quote>almost the whole of</quote>; and so on down to 
    <valsi>piso'u</valsi>, 
    <quote>a tiny part of</quote>. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-dwJI"/> shows.</para>
    <para>In addition to these cmavo, there is 
    <valsi>no'o</valsi>, meaning 
    
    <quote>the typical value</quote>, and 
    
    <jbophrase>pino'o</jbophrase>, meaning 
    <quote>the typical portion</quote>: Sometimes 
    <valsi>no'o</valsi> can be translated 
    
    <quote>the average value</quote>, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.</para>

    <valsi>tu'o</valsi> and the null operator 
    
    
    <valsi>ge'a</valsi>. The first is suitable when there are too few operands, the second when there are too many. For example, suppose we wanted to express the numerical negation operator 
    
    
    
    
    <valsi>va'a</valsi> in infix form. We would use:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>RP</primary><secondary>as abbreviation for reverse Polish notation</secondary></indexterm> So far, the Lojban notational conventions have mapped fairly familiar kinds of mathematical discourse. The use of forethought operators may have seemed odd when applied to 
    <quote>+</quote>, but when applied to 
    <quote>f</quote> they appear as the usual functional notation. Now comes a sharp break. Reverse Polish (RP) notation represents something completely different; even mathematicians don't use it much. (The only common uses of RP, in fact, are in some kinds of calculators and in the implementation of some programming languages.)</para>

(Polish notation, where the operator precedes its operands, is another name for forethought mekso of the kind explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-forethought"/>.) The number of operands per operator is always fixed. No parentheses are required or permitted. In Lojban, RP notation is always explicitly marked by a 
    <valsi>fu'a</valsi> at the beginning of the expression; there is no terminator. Here is a simple example:</para>

    <valsi>tu'o</valsi> and the null operator 
    
    
    <valsi>ge'a</valsi> provide a simple solution. A one-operand operator like

    <jbophrase>tu'o va'a</jbophrase>. The 
    
    
    <valsi>tu'o</valsi> provides the second operand, which is semantically ignored but grammatically necessary. Likewise, the three-operand version of 
    
    <valsi>gei</valsi> appears in reverse Polish as 
    <jbophrase>ge'a gei</jbophrase>, where the

    <title>Explicit operator precedence</title>
    
    <para>As mentioned earlier, Lojban does provide a way for the precedences of operators to be explicitly declared, although current parsers do not understand these declarations.</para>
    <para> The declaration is made in the form of a metalinguistic comment using 
    
    <valsi>ti'o</valsi>, a member of selma'o SEI. 
    
    <valsi>sei</valsi>, the other member of SEI, is used to insert metalinguistic comments on a bridi which give information about the discourse which the bridi comprises. The format of a 
    <valsi>ti'o</valsi> declaration has not been formally established, but presumably would take the form of mentioning a mekso operator and then giving it either an absolute numerical precedence on some pre-established scale, or else specifying relative precedences between new operators and existing operators.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>operator precedence</primary><secondary>plans for future</secondary></indexterm> In future, we hope to create an improved machine parser that can understand declarations of the precedences of simple operators belonging to selma'o VUhU. Originally, all operators would have the same precedence. Declarations would have the effect of raising the specified cmavo of VUhU to higher precedence levels. Complex operators formed with 
    <valsi>na'u</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ni'e</valsi>, or 
    
    <valsi>ma'o</valsi> would remain at the standard low precedence; declarations with respect to them are for future implementation efforts. It is probable that such a parser would have a set of 
    <quote>commonly assumed precedences</quote> built into it (selectable by a special 
    <valsi>ti'o</valsi> declaration) that would match mathematical intuition: times higher than plus, and so on.</para>

    <title>Introductory</title>
    <para>This chapter is incurably miscellaneous. It describes the cmavo that specify the structure of Lojban texts, from the largest scale (paragraphs) to the smallest (single words). There are fewer examples than are found in other chapters of this book, since the linguistic mechanisms described are generally made use of in conversation or else in long documents.</para>
    <para>This chapter is also not very self-contained. It makes passing reference to a great many concepts which are explained in full only in other chapters. The alternative would be a chapter on text structure which was as complex as all the other chapters put together. Lojban is a unified language, and it is not possible to understand any part of it (in full) before understanding every part of it (to some degree).</para>

    <title>Sentences: I</title>
    <para>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</para>
    <cmavo-list>
      <cmavo-entry>
        <cmavo>.i</cmavo>

      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>audio-visually isomorphic</primary></indexterm> Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and the start of the following one. In written English, a period serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour (rising or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause. Lojban uses a single separator: the cmavo 
    
    <valsi>i</valsi> (of selma'o I):</para>

        <gloss>I go to-the store. You walk on-the ice.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sentences</primary><secondary>separator for joining</secondary></indexterm> The word 
    <quote>separator</quote> should be noted. 
    <valsi>i</valsi> is not normally used after the last sentence nor before the first one, although both positions are technically grammatical. 
    <valsi>i</valsi> signals a new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same speaker. The relationship between the sentences is left vague, except in stories, where the relationship usually is temporal, and the following sentence states something that happened after the previous sentence.</para>
    
    <para>Note that although the first letter of an English sentence is capitalized, the cmavo 
    <valsi>i</valsi> is never capitalized. In writing, it is appropriate to place extra space before 
    <valsi>i</valsi> to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of Lojban writing, every 
    <valsi>i</valsi> is placed at the beginning of a line, possibly leaving space at the end of the previous line.</para>
    <para>An 
    <valsi>i</valsi> cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of the following sentence is different from the speaker of the preceding sentence, depending on whether the sentences are felt to be connected or not.</para>
    <para>An 
    <valsi>i</valsi> cmavo can be compounded with a logical or non-logical connective (a jek or joik), a modal or tense connective, or both: these constructs are explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-modal-connectives"/>, 
    <xref linkend="section-tense-connection"/>, and 
    <xref linkend="section-bridi-connection"/>. In all cases, the 
    <valsi>i</valsi> comes first in the compound. Attitudinals can also be attached to an 
    <valsi>i</valsi> if they are meant to apply to the whole sentence: see 
    <xref linkend="section-scope"/>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sentences</primary><secondary>close grouping</secondary></indexterm> There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of sentences closely together. If the 
    <valsi>i</valsi> (with or without connectives) is followed by 
    <valsi>bo</valsi> (of selma'o BO), then the two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely grouped than sentences connected by 
    <valsi>i</valsi> alone.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>title</primary><secondary>specifying with tu'e…tu'u</secondary></indexterm> Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by 
    <valsi>tu'e</valsi> (of selma'o TUhE) and followed by 
    <valsi>tu'u</valsi> (of selma'o TUhU) to fuse them into a single unit. A common use of 
    <valsi>tu'e</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>tu'u</valsi> is to group the sentences which compose a poem: the title sentence would precede the group, separated from it by 
    <valsi>i</valsi>. Another use might be a set of directions, where each numbered direction might be surrounded by 
    <valsi>tu'e</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>tu'u</valsi> and contain one or more sentences separated by 
    <valsi>i</valsi>. Grouping with 
    <valsi>tu'e</valsi> and 
    <valsi>tu'u</valsi> is analogous to grouping with 
    <valsi>ke</valsi> and 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi> to establish the scope of logical or non-logical connectives (see 
    <xref linkend="section-afterthought-connectives-grouping"/>).</para>

    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

        <cmavo>ni'o</cmavo>

    </cmavo-list>
    <para>The paragraph is a concept used in writing systems for two purposes: to indicate changes of topic, and to break up the hard-to-read appearance of large blocks of text on the page. The former function is represented in both spoken and written Lojban by the cmavo 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> and 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi>, both of selma'o NIhO. Of these two, 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> is the more common. By convention, written Lojban is broken into paragraphs just before any 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> or 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi>, but a very long passage on a single topic might be paragraphed before an 
    <valsi>i</valsi>. On the other hand, it is conventional in English to start a new paragraph in dialogue when a new speaker starts, but this convention is not commonly observed in Lojban dialogues. Of course, none of these conventions affect meaning in any way.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>paragraphs</primary><secondary>separator</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>old topic</primary></indexterm> A 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> can take the place of an 
    <valsi>i</valsi> as a sentence separator, and in addition signals a new topic or paragraph. Grammatically, any number of 
    
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> cmavo can appear consecutively and are equivalent to a single one; semantically, a greater number of 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> cmavo indicates a larger-scale change of topic. This feature allows complexly structured text, with topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics, to be represented clearly and unambiguously in both spoken and written Lojban. However, some conventional differences do exist between 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> in writing and in conversation.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>paragraph separation</primary><secondary>written text</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>tense</primary><secondary>scope effect of new paragraph</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicators</primary><secondary>scope effect of new paragraph</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>pro-sumti</primary><secondary>scope effect of new paragraph</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>pro-bridi</primary><secondary>scope effect of new paragraph</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>paragraphs</primary><secondary>effects on scope</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>discursive indicator</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>indicator scope</primary></indexterm> In written text, a single 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> is a mere discursive indicator of a new subject, whereas 
    
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'o</jbophrase> marks a change in the context. In this situation, 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'o</jbophrase> implicitly cancels the definitions of all pro-sumti of selma'o KOhA as well as pro-bridi of selma'o GOhA. (Explicit cancelling is expressed by the cmavo 
    <valsi>da'o</valsi> of selma'o DAhO, which has the free grammar of an indicator &ndash; it can appear almost anywhere.) The use of 
    
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'o</jbophrase> does not affect indicators (of selma'o UI) or tense references, but 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'oni'o</jbophrase>, indicating a drastic change of topic, would serve to reset both indicators and tenses. (See 
    <xref linkend="section-attitudinal-scope"/> for a discussion of indicator scope.)</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>paragraph separation</primary><secondary>spoken text</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>Arabian Nights</primary></indexterm> In spoken text, which is inherently less structured, these levels are reduced by one, with 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> indicating a change in context sufficient to cancel pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignment. On the other hand, in a book, or in stories within stories such as 
    
    <quote>The Arabian Nights</quote>, further levels may be expressed by extending the 
    
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> string as needed. Normally, a written text will begin with the number of 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> cmavo needed to signal the largest scale division which the text contains. 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> strings may be subscripted to label each context of discourse: see 
    <xref linkend="section-subscripts-general"/>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>previous topic</primary></indexterm> 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi> is similar in effect to 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi>, but indicates the resumption of a previous topic. In speech, it is analogous to (but much shorter than) such English discursive phrases as 
    
    <quote>But getting back to the point ...</quote>. By default, the topic resumed is that in effect before the last 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi>. When subtopics are nested within topics, then 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi> would resume the previous subtopic and 
    
    <jbophrase>no'ino'i</jbophrase> the previous topic. Note that 
    
    <valsi>no'i</valsi> also resumes tense and pro-sumti assignments dropped at the previous 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>subscripted topics</primary></indexterm> If a 
    <valsi>ni'o</valsi> is subscripted, then a 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi> with the same subscript is assumed to be a continuation of it. A 
    <valsi>no'i</valsi> may also have a negative subscript, which would specify counting backwards a number of paragraphs and resuming the topic found thereby.</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-mK5Y"/> are inherently vague, and this difference between 
    <valsi>ponse</valsi> (which expects a physical object in x2) and 
    <valsi>djica</valsi> is ignored. See 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-EXeq"/> for another topic/comment sentence.</para>
    <para>The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as well, but in Lojban the sumti in the x1 place is not necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don't necessarily have a 
    <quote>subject</quote> in the English sense.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>questions</primary><secondary>truth</secondary></indexterm> Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form

    <valsi>ku</valsi>, for reasons explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-non-logical-connectives"/>. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former.

    </example>
    <para>This does not imply that I go to the store before I go to the house: that meaning requires a tense. The sumti are simply numbered for convenience of reference. Like other free modifiers, the utterance ordinals can be inserted almost anywhere in a sentence without affecting its grammar or its meaning.</para>
    
    
    <para>Any of the Lojban numbers can be used with MAI: 
    <valsi>romai</valsi>, for example, means 
    <quote>all-thly</quote> or 
    <quote>lastly</quote>. Likewise, if you are enumerating a long list and have forgotten which number is wanted next, you can say 
    <jbophrase>ny.mai</jbophrase>, or 
    <quote>Nthly</quote>.</para>
    
    <para>The difference between 
    <valsi>mai</valsi> and 
    <valsi>mo'o</valsi> is that 
    <valsi>mo'o</valsi> enumerates larger subdivisions of a text; 
    <valsi>mai</valsi> was designed for lists of numbered items, whereas 
    
    <valsi>mo'o</valsi> was intended to subdivide structured works. If this chapter were translated into Lojban, it might number each section with

    <para>Normally, an attitudinal applies to the preceding word only. However, if the preceding word is a structural cmavo which begins or ends a whole construction, then that whole construction is affected by the attitudinal:</para>

    <para>Likewise, an attitudinal meant to cover a whole paragraph can be attached to

    <para>However, sometimes it is necessary to be more specific about the range of one or more attitudinals, particularly if the range crosses the boundaries of standard Lojban syntactic constructions. The cmavo 
    <valsi>fu'e</valsi> (of selma'o FUhE) and 
    
    <valsi>fu'o</valsi> (of selma'o FUhO) provide explicit scope markers. Placing 
    
    <valsi>fu'e</valsi> in front of an attitudinal disconnects it from what precedes it, and instead says that it applies to all following words until further notice. The notice is given by 
    
    <valsi>fu'o</valsi>, which can appear anywhere and cancels all in-force attitudinals. For example:</para>

    <jbophrase>blanu zdani ponse</jbophrase> is marked as a belief of the speaker. Naturally, the attitudinal scope markers do not affect the rules for interpreting multi-part tanru:

    </example>
    <para>But in fact there are four different flavors of quotation in the language, involving six cmavo of six different selma'o. This being the case, quotation deserves some elaboration.</para>
    <para>The simplest kind of quotation, exhibited in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-6SBj"/>, uses the cmavo 
    <valsi>lu</valsi> (of selma'o LU) as the opening quotation mark, and the cmavo 
    
    <valsi>li'u</valsi> (of selma'o LIhU) as the closing quotation mark. The text between 
    <valsi>lu</valsi> and 
    <valsi>li'u</valsi> must be a valid, parseable Lojban text. If the quotation is ungrammatical, so is the surrounding expression. The cmavo 
    <valsi>li'u</valsi> is technically an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to elide it except at the end of text.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <valsi>lo'u</valsi> (of selma'o LOhU) and 
    <valsi>le'u</valsi> (of selma'o LEhU) are used to surround a quotation that is not necessarily grammatical Lojban. However, the text must consist of morphologically correct Lojban words (as defined in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-morphology"/>), so that the 
    <valsi>le'u</valsi> can be picked out reliably. The words need not be meaningful, but they must be recognizable as cmavo, brivla, or cmene. Quotation with 
    <valsi>lo'u</valsi> is essential to quoting ungrammatical Lojban for teaching in the language, the equivalent of the * that is used in English to mark such errors:</para>

    <para>The cmavo

    <valsi>zo</valsi> allows a metalinguistic word to be referenced without having it act on the surrounding text. The word must be a morphologically legal (but not necessarily meaningful) single Lojban word; compound cmavo are not permitted. For example:</para>

    <para>The cmavo

    <jbophrase>zoi X. text .X</jbophrase>, where X is a Lojban word (called the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream. It is common, but not required, to use the lerfu word (of selma'o BY) which corresponds to the Lojban name of the language being quoted:</para>

    <para>Within written text, the Lojban written word used as a delimiting word may not appear, whereas within spoken text, the sound of the delimiting word may not be uttered. This leads to occasional breakdowns of audio-visual isomorphism:

    <valsi>le'u</valsi> is used either as the delimiting word for the

    <valsi>lo'u</valsi> quotation will be prematurely terminated. Therefore,

    <valsi>lai</valsi>, 
    <valsi>la'i</valsi> (all of selma'o LA) and

    <para>The cmavo 
    <valsi>la'o</valsi> also belongs to selma'o ZOI, and is mentioned here for completeness, although it does not signal the beginning of a quotation. Instead, 
    <valsi>la'o</valsi> serves to mark non-Lojban names, especially the Linnaean binomial names (such as 
    
    <quote>Homo sapiens</quote>) which are the internationally standardized names for species of animals and plants. Internationally known names which can more easily be recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as 
    
    <quote>Goethe</quote>, can also appear in Lojban text with 
    
    <valsi>la'o</valsi>:</para>

    <para>Using

    <quote>higher</quote> metalinguistic levels in determining their referent. It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to refer to lower metalinguistic levels. For example, the English 
    
    <quote>he said</quote> in a conversation is metalinguistic. For this purpose, quotations are considered to be at a lower metalinguistic level than the surrounding context (a quoted text cannot refer to the statements of the one who quotes it), whereas parenthetical remarks are considered to be at a higher level than the context.</para>

    <valsi>.y.</valsi> (of selma'o Y). This resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written 
    
    <quote>uh</quote> (or 
    <quote>er</quote>), but differs from it in the requirement for pauses before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be mistaken for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the speaker. Since vowel length is not significant in Lojban, the 
    <letteral>y</letteral> sound can be dragged out for as long as necessary. Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required pauses are respected.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>hesitation sound</primary></indexterm> Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal language, English-speakers may question the need for a formal cmavo.

    <quote>este</quote> in some dialects of Spanish, roughly meaning 
    <quote>that is</quote>), and Lojban's audio-visual isomorphism requires a written representation of all meaningful spoken behavior. Of course,

    <valsi>fa'o</valsi> (of selma'o FAhO) is the usually omitted marker for the end of a text; it can be used in computer interaction to indicate the end of input or output, or for explicitly giving up the floor during a discussion. It is outside the regular grammar, and the machine parser takes it as an unconditional signal to stop parsing unless it is quoted with 
    
    
    
    <valsi>zo</valsi> or with 
    <jbophrase>lo'u ... le'u</jbophrase>. In particular, it is not used at the end of subordinate texts quoted with

    <title>YACC Grammar of Lojban</title>
    <para>The following two listings constitute the formal grammar of Lojban. The first version is written in the YACC language, which is used to describe parsers, and has been used to create a parser for Lojban texts. This parser is available from the Logical Language Group. The second listing is in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and represents the same grammar in a more human-readable form. (In case of discrepancies, the YACC version is official.) There is a cross-reference listing for each format that shows, for each selma'o and rule, which rules refer to it.</para>
    
    <para>/* /*Lojban Machine Grammar, Final Baseline The Lojban Machine Grammardocument is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author,The Logical Language Group, Inc.</para>
    <para>grammar.300 */</para>
    <para>/* The Lojban machine parsing algorithm is a multi-step process. The YACC machine grammar presented here is an amalgam of those steps, concatenated so as to allow YACC to verify the syntactic ambiguity of the grammar. YACC is used to generate a parser for a portion of the grammar, which is LALR1 (the type of grammar that YACC is designed to identify and process successfully), but most of the rest of the grammar must be parsed using some language-coded processing.</para>
    
    <bridgehead>Step 1 &ndash; Lexing</bridgehead>
    <para>From phonemes, stress, and pause, it is possible to resolve Lojban unambiguously into a stream of words. Any machine processing of speech will have to have some way to deal with <quote>non-Lojban</quote> failures of fluent speech, of course. The resolved words can be expressed as a text file using Lojban's phonetic spelling rules.</para>
    <para>The following steps assume that there is the possibility of non-Lojban text within the Lojban text (delimited appropriately). Such non-Lojban text may not be reducible from speech phonetically. However, step 2 allows the filtering of a phonetically transcribed text stream, to recognize such portions of non-Lojban text where properly delimited, without interference with the parsing algorithm.</para>
    
    <bridgehead>Step 2 &ndash; Filtering</bridgehead>
    <para>From start to end, performing the following filtering and lexing tasks using the given order of precedence in case of conflict:</para>
    <orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">
      <listitem>
        <para>If the Lojban word <valsi>zoi</valsi> (selma'o ZOI) is identified, take the following Lojban word (which should be end delimited with a pause for separation from the following non-Lojban text) as an opening delimiter. Treat all text following that delimiter, until that delimiter recurs 
        <emphasis>after a pause</emphasis>, as grammatically a single token (labelled <quote> 
        <xref linkend="cll_yacc-699"/></quote> in this grammar). There is no need for processing within this text except as necessary to find the closing delimiter.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the Lojban word <valsi>zo</valsi> (selma'o ZO) is identified, treat the following Lojban word as a token labelled <quote> 
        <xref linkend="cll_yacc-698"/></quote>, instead of lexing it by its normal grammatical function.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the Lojban word <valsi>lo'u</valsi> (selma'o LOhU) is identified, search for the closing delimiter <valsi>le'u</valsi> (selma'o LEhU), ignoring any such closing delimiters absorbed by the previous two steps. The text between the delimiters should be treated as the single token <quote> 
        <xref linkend="cll_yacc-697"/></quote>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Categorize all remaining words into their Lojban selma'o category, including the various delimiters mentioned in the previous steps. In all steps after step 2, only the selma'o token type is significant for each word.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the word <valsi>si</valsi> (selma'o SI) is identified, erase it and the previous word (or token, if the previous text has been condensed into a single token by one of the above rules).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the word <valsi>sa</valsi> (selma'o SA) is identified, erase it and all preceding text as far back as necessary to make what follows attach to what precedes. (This rule is hard to formalize and may receive further definition later.)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the word <valsi>su</valsi> (selma'o SU) is identified, erase it and all preceding text back to and including the first preceding token word which is in one of the selma'o: NIhO, LU, TUhE, and TO. However, if speaker identification is available, a SU shall only erase to the beginning of a speaker's discourse, unless it occurs at the beginning of a speaker's discourse. (Thus, if the speaker has said something, two adjacent uses of <valsi>su</valsi> are required to erase the entire conversation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <bridgehead>Step 3 &ndash; Termination</bridgehead>
    <para>If the text contains a FAhO, treat that as the end-of-text and ignore everything that follows it.</para>
    <bridgehead>Step 4 &ndash; Absorption of Grammar-Free Tokens</bridgehead>
    <para>In a new pass, perform the following absorptions (absorption means that the token is removed from the grammar for processing in following steps, and optionally reinserted, grouped with the absorbing token after parsing is completed).</para>
    <orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">
      <listitem>
        <para>Token sequences of the form any - (ZEI - any) ..., where there may be any number of ZEIs, are merged into a single token of selma'o BRIVLA.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Absorb all selma'o BAhE tokens into the following token. If they occur at the end of text, leave them alone (they are errors).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Absorb all selma'o BU tokens into the previous token. Relabel the previous token as selma'o BY.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If selma'o NAI occurs immediately following any of tokens UI or CAI, absorb the NAI into the previous token.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Absorb all members of selma'o DAhO, FUhO, FUhE, UI, Y, and CAI into the previous token. All of these null grammar tokens are permitted following any word of the grammar, without interfering with that word's grammatical function, or causing any effect on the grammatical interpretation of any other token in the text. Indicators at the beginning of text are explicitly handled by the grammar.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <bridgehead>Step 5 &ndash; Insertion of Lexer Lexemes</bridgehead>
    <para>Lojban is not in itself LALR1. There are words whose grammatical function is determined by following tokens. As a result, parsing of the YACC grammar must take place in two steps. In the first step, certain strings of tokens with defined grammars are identified, and either</para>
    <orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">
      <listitem>
        <para>are replaced by a single specified <quote>lexer token</quote> for step 6, or</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>the lexer token is inserted in front of the token string to identify it uniquely.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>The YACC grammar included herein is written to make YACC generation of a step 6 parser easy regardless of whether a. or b. is used. The strings of tokens to be labelled with lexer tokens are found in rule terminals labelled with numbers between 900 and 1099. These rules are defined with the lexer tokens inserted, with the result that it can be verified that the language is LALR1 under option b. after steps 1 through 4 have been performed. Alternatively, if option a. is to be used, these rules are commented out, and the rule terminals labelled from 800 to 900 refer to the lexer tokens 
    
    <emphasis>without</emphasis> the strings of defining tokens. Two sets of lexer tokens are defined in the token set so as to be compatible with either option.</para>
    <para>In this step, the strings must be labelled with the appropriate lexer tokens. Order of inserting lexer tokens 
    <emphasis>IS</emphasis> significant, since some shorter strings that would be marked with a lexer token may be found inside longer strings. If the tokens are inserted before or in place of the shorter strings, the longer strings cannot be identified.</para>
    <para>If option a. is chosen, the following order of insertion works correctly (it is not the only possible order): <!-- xref instead of "option a."? -->
    <simplelist type="inline">
      <member>A</member>
      <member>C</member>
      <member>D</member>
      <member>B</member>
      <member>U</member>

    </simplelist>
    . This ensures that the longest rules will be processed first; a PA+MAI will not be seen as a PA with a dangling MAI at the end, for example. </para>
    <bridgehead>Step 6 &ndash; YACC Parsing</bridgehead>
    <para>YACC should now be able to parse the Lojban text in accordance with the rule terminals labelled from 1 to 899 under option 5a, or 1 to 1099 under option 5b. Comment out the rules beyond 900 if option 5a is used, and comment out the 700-series of lexer-tokens, while restoring the series of lexer tokens numbered from 900 up.</para>

   only a problem for a LOhU quote itself, since the LEhU clossing this
   quote would otherwise close the outer quotes, which is incorrect.  For
   this purpose, we will cheat on the use of ZO in such a quote (since this
   is ungrammatical text, it is a sign ignored by the parser).  Use ZO to
   mark any nested quotation LOhU.  The preparser then will absorb it by
   the ZO rule, before testing for LOhU.  This is obviously not the
   standard usage for ZO, which would otherwise cause the result to be a
   sumti.  But, since the result will be part of an unparsed string anyway,
   it doesn't matter.  */

/* It may be seen that any of the ZO/ZOI/LOhU trio of quotation markers
   may contain the powerful metalinguistic erasers.  Since these quotations

   are not parsed internally, these operators are ignored within the quote.
   To erase a ZO, then, two SI's are needed after giving a quoted word of
   any type.  ZOI takes four SI's, with the ENTIRE BODY OF THE QUOTE
   treated as a single <quote>word</quote> since it is one selma'o.  Thus one for the
   quote body, two for the single word delimiters, and one for the ZOI.  In
   LOhU, the entire body is treated as a single word, so three SI's can
   erase it.  */

/* All rule terminator names with <quote>gap</quote> in them are potentially
   elidable, where such elision does not cause an ambiguity.  This is
   implemented through use of the YACC <quote>error</quote> token, which effectively
   recovers from an elision.  */

/* The following are <quote>Lexer-only rules</quote>, covered by steps 1-4 described
   at the beginning.  The grammar of these constructs is nonexistent,
   except possibly in cases where they interact with each other.  Even
   there, however, the effects are semantic rather than grammatical.  Where
   it is believed possible that conflicts could exist, the grammar of these
   constructs has been put in the above grammar, even though the
   lexer/Preparser will actually prevent these from being passed thru to
   the parse routine.  (Otherwise we have to put unacceptably fancy code in
   the PreParser to determine just when these can be passed thru, and when
   they can't.)  Constructs in this category include quotes and indicators
   as defined above.  (The above grammar handles utterance scope
   (free_modifier) and clause scope (gap) applications of the latter,
   however, and indicators should be allowed to be absorbed into almost any
   word without changing its grammar.

    <para>Lojban Machine Grammar, EBNF Version, Final Baseline</para>
    <para>This EBNF document is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author, The Logical Language Group, Inc. Contact that organization at: 2904 Beau Lane, Fairfax VA 22031 USA 703-385-0273 (intl: +1 703 385 0273)</para>
    <para>Explanation of notation: All rules have the form:</para>
    <para>name 
    <subscript>number</subscript>= bnf-expression</para>
    <para>which means that the grammatical construct <quote>name</quote> is defined by <quote>bnf-expression</quote>. The number cross-references this grammar with the rule numbers in the YACC grammar. The names are the same as those in the YACC grammar, except that subrules are labeled with A, B, C, ... in the YACC grammar and with 1, 2, 3, ... in this grammar. In addition, rule 971 is <quote>simple_tag</quote> in the YACC grammar but <quote>stag</quote> in this grammar, because of its frequent appearance.</para>

        <para>Names in lower case are grammatical constructs.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>... represents optional repetition of the construct to the left. Left-grouping is implied; right-grouping is shown by explicit self-referential recursion with no <quote>...</quote></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>() serves to indicate the grouping of the other operators. Otherwise, <quote>...</quote> binds closer than &amp;, which binds closer than |.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para># is shorthand for <quote>[free ...]</quote>, a construct which appears in many places.</para>
