          <h3>12. Event-type abstractors and event contour tenses</h3>

    <p>This section is a logical continuation of <a
    href=../3/>Section 3</a>.</p>

    <p>There exists a relationship between the four types of events
    explained in <a href=../3/>Section 3</a> and the event contour
    tense cmavo of selma’o ZAhO. The specific cmavo of NU and of
    ZAhO are mutually interdefining; the ZAhO contours were chosen
    to fit the needs of the NU event types and vice versa. Event
    contours are explained in full in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter
    10</a>, and only summarized here.</p>

    <p>The purpose of ZAhO cmavo is to represent the natural
    portions of an event, such as the beginning, the middle, and
    the end. They fall into several groups:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo “pu’o”, “ca’o”, and “ba’o” represent
      spans of time: before an event begins, while it is going on,
      and after it is over, respectively.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo “co’a”, “de’a”, “di’a”, and “co’u”
      represent points of time: the start of an event, the
      temporary stopping of an event, the resumption of an event
      after a stop, and the end of an event, respectively. Not all
      events can have breaks in them, in which case “de’a” and
      “di’a” do not apply.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo “mo’u” and “za’o” correspond to “co’u”
      and “ba’o” respectively, in the case of those events which
      have a natural ending point that may not be the same as the
      actual ending point: “mo’u” refers to the natural ending
      point, and “za’o” to the time between the natural ending
      point and the actual ending point (the “excessive” or
      “superfective” part of the event).</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo “co’i” represents an entire event considered
      as a point-event or achievement.</dd>
    </dl>
    All these cmavo are applicable to events seen as processes and
    abstracted with “pu’u”. Only processes have enough internal
    structure to make all these points and spans of time
    meaningful. 

    <p>For events seen as states and abstracted with “za’i”, the
    meaningful event contours are the spans “pu’o”, “ca’o”, and
    “ba’o”; the starting and ending points “co’a” and “co’u”,
    and the achievement contour “co’i”. States do not have
    natural endings distinct from their actual ending. (It is an
    open question whether states can be stopped and resumed.)</p>

    <p>For events seen as activities and abstracted with “zu’o”,
    the meaningful event contours are the spans “pu’o”, “ca’o”,
    and “ba’o”, and the achievement contour “co’i”. Because
    activities are inherently cyclic and repetitive, the beginning
    and ending points are not well-defined: you do not know whether
    an activity has truly begun until it begins to repeat.</p>

    <p>For events seen as point-events and abstracted with
    “mu’e”, the meaningful event contours are the spans “pu’o”
    and “ba’o” but not “ca’o” (a point-event has no duration),
    and the achievement contour “co’i”.</p>

    <p>Note that the parts of events are themselves events, and may
    be treated as such. The points in time may be seen as “mu’e”
    point-events; the spans of time may constitute processes or
    activities. Therefore, Lojban allows us to express processes
    within processes, activities within states, and many other
    complicated abstract things.</p>
