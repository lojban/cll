          <h3><a id="4" name="4">4. Property abstractions</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ka  NU  property abstractor
    ce'u    KOhA    
</pre>

    <p>The things described by ``le nu'' descriptions (or, to put
    it another way, the things of which ``nu'' selbri may correctly
    be predicated) are only moderately ``abstract''. They are still
    closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties,
    however, are much more ethereal. What is ``the property of
    being blue'', or ``the property of being a go-er''? They are
    what logicians call ``intensions''. If John has a heart, then
    ``the property of having a heart'' is an abstract object which,
    when applied to John, is true. In fact,</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  la djan. cu se risna zo'e
    John has-as-heart something-unspecified.
    John has a heart.
</pre>
    has the same truth conditions as 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>  la djan. cu ckaji
        le ka se risna [zo'e] [kei]
    John has-the-property
        the property-of having-as-heart something.
    John has the property of having a heart.
</pre>
    (The English word ``have'' frequently appears in any discussion
    of Lojban properties: things are said to ``have'' properties,
    but this is not the same sense of ``have'' as in ``I have
    money'', which is possession.) 

    <p>Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often
    wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>  do cnino mi
        le ka xunre [kei]
    You are-new to-me
        in-the-quality-of-the property-of being-red.
    You are new to me in redness.
</pre>
    (The English suffix ``-ness'' often signals a property
    abstraction, as does the suffix ``-ity''.) 

    <p>We can also move the property description to the x1 place of
    <a href="../4/#3">Example 4.3</a>, producing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  le ka do xunre [kei] cu cnino mi
    The property-of your being-red is-new to me.
    Your redness is new to me.
</pre>
    It would be suitable to use <a href="../4/#3">Examples 4.3</a>
    and <a href="../4/#4">4.4</a> to someone who has returned from
    the beach with a sunburn. 

    <p>There are several different properties that can be extracted
    from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is
    ``understood'' as being specified externally. Thus:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">4.5)</a>  ka mi prami [zo'e] [kei]
    a-property-of me loving something-unspecified
</pre>
    is quite different from 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">4.6)</a>  ka [zo'e] prami mi [kei]
    a-property-of something-unspecified loving me
</pre>

    <p>In particular, sentences like <a href="../4/#7">Example
    4.7</a> and <a href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> are quite different
    in meaning:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4-7"
name="4-7">4.7)</a>  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X)
    I love John more than I love George.

<a id="4-8"
name="4-8">4.8)</a>   la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka prami mi
    John exceeds George in the property of (X loves me).
    John loves me more than George loves me.
</pre>

    <p>The ``X'' used in the glosses of <a href="../4/#7">Examples
    4.7</a> through <a href="../4/#8">4.8</a> as a place-holder
    cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because
    ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can
    fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in <a href=../2/>Section 2</a>.
    Instead, the cmavo ``ce'u'' of selma'o KOhA is employed when an
    explicit sumti is wanted. (The form ``X'' will be used in
    literal translations.)</p>

    <p>Therefore, an explicit equivalent of <a href="../4/#7">Example
    4.7</a>, with no ellipsis, is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4-9"
name="4-9">4.9)</a>  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami ce'u
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X).
</pre>
    and of <a href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> is: 
<pre>
<a id="4-10"
name="4-10">4.10)</a>    la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka ce'u prami mi
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (X loves me).
</pre>

    <p>This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4-11"
name="4-11">4.11)</a>    le ka [zo'e] dunda le xirma [zo'e] [kei]
    the property-of giving the horse
</pre>
    into 
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">4.12)</a>    le ka ce'u dunda le xirma
        [zo'e] [kei]
    the property-of (X is-a-giver of-the horse
        to someone-unspecified)
    the property of being a giver of the horse
</pre>
    which is the most natural interpretation of <a
    href="../4/#11">Example 4.11</a>, versus 
<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">4.13)</a>    le ka [zo'e] dunda
        le xirma ce'u [kei]
    the property-of (someone-unspecified
        is-a-giver of-the horse to X)
    the property of being one to whom the horse is given
</pre>
    which is also a possible interpretation. 

    <p>It is also possible to have more than one ``ce'u'' in a
    ``ka'' abstraction, which transforms it from a property
    abstraction into a relationship abstraction, a resource of the
    language that has not yet been explored.</p>

    <p>The place structure of ``ka'' abstraction selbri is
    simply:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is a property of (the bridi)</dd>
    </dl>
