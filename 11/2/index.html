          <h3>2. Event abstraction</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   nu  NU  event abstractor
</pre>
    The examples in <a href=../1/>Section 1</a> made use of “nu”
    as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common
    abstractor in Lojban text. Its purpose is to capture the event
    or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not confuse the
    “le” description built on a “nu” abstraction with ordinary
    descriptions based on “le” alone. The following sumti are
    quite distinct: 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  le klama
    the comer, that which comes

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   le se klama
    the destination

<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>   le te klama
    the origin

<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>   le ve klama
    the route

<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>   le xe klama
    the means of transportation

<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>   le nu klama
    the event of someone coming to somewhere
        from somewhere by some route using some means
</pre>
    <a href="../2/#1">Examples 2.1</a> through <a
    href="../2/#5">2.5</a> are descriptions that isolate the five
    individual sumti places of the selbri “klama”. <a
    href="../2/#6">Example 2.6</a> describes something associated
    with the bridi as a whole: the event of it. 

    <p>In Lojban, the term “event” is divorced from its ordinary
    English sense of something that happens over a short period of
    time. The description:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">2.7)</a>  le nu mi vasxu
    the event-of my breathing
</pre>
    is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal
    circumstances). On the other hand, 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">2.8)</a>  le nu la djan. cinba la djein.
    the event-of John kissing Jane
</pre>
    is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal
    circumstances). 

    <p>We can see from <a href="../2/#6">Examples 2.6</a> through
    <a href="../2/#8">2.8</a> that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the
    bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a
    sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be
    able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is,
    or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It
    is extremely common for “nu” abstractions in descriptions to
    have the x1 place ellipsized:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">2.9)</a>  mi nelci le nu limna
    I like the event-of swimming.
    I like swimming.
</pre>
    is elliptical, and most probably means: 
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">2.10)</a>    mi nelci le nu mi limna
    I like the event-of I swim.
</pre>

    <p>In the proper context, of course, <a href="../2/#9">Example
    2.9</a> could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its
    English equivalent, “I like swimming”, can't be interpreted
    as “I like Frank's swimming”; this is a fundamental
    distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted
    sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should
    mean.</p>

    <p>Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can
    sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of <a
    href="../2/#10">Example 2.10</a>, the appearance of “le se
    nelci” (“that which is liked”) is in effect an
    abstraction:</p>
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">2.11)</a>    le se nelci cu cafne
    The liked-thing is-frequent.
    The thing which I like happens often.
</pre>
    which in this context means 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>My swimming happens often.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Event descriptions with “le nu” are commonly used to fill
    the “under conditions...” places, among others, of gismu and
    lujvo place structures:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">2.12)</a>    la lojban. cu frili mi
        le nu mi tadni [kei]
    Lojban is-easy for-me
        under-conditions-the event-of I study
    Lojban is easy for me when I study.
</pre>
    (The “when” of the English would also be appropriate for a
    construction involving a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence
    says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.) 

    <p>The place structure of a “nu” abstraction selbri is
    simply:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is an event of (the bridi)</dd>
    </dl>
