          <h3>3. Types of event abstractions</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
     mu'e    NU                  point-event abstractor
     pu'u    NU                  process abstractor
     zu'o    NU                  activity abstractor
     za'i    NU                  state abstractor
</pre>

    <p>Event abstractions with “nu” suffice to express all kinds
    of events, whether long, short, unique, repetitive, or
    whatever. Lojban also has more finely discriminating machinery
    for talking about events, however. There are four other
    abstractors of selma'o NU for talking about four specific types
    of events, or four ways of looking at the same event.</p>

    <p>An event considered as a point in time is called a
    “point-event”, or sometimes an “achievement”. (This latter
    word should be divorced, in this context, from all connotations
    of success or triumph.) A point-event can be extended in
    duration, but it is still a point-event if it is thought of as
    unitary, having no internal structure. The abstractor “mu'e”
    means “point-event-of”:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3-1"
name="3-1">3.1)</a>  le mu'e la djan. catra la djim. cu zekri
    the point-event-of (John kills Jim) is-a-crime
    John’s killing Jim (considered as a point in time)
        is a crime.
</pre>
    An event considered as extended in time, and structured with a
    beginning, a middle containing one or more stages, and an end,
    is called a “process”. The abstractor “pu'u” means
    “process-of”: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>  ca'o le pu'u le latmo balje'a
        cu porpi kei
        so'i je'atru cu selcatra
    [continuitive] the process-of( the Latin great-state
        breaking-up )
        many state-rulers were-killed
    During the fall of the Roman Empire,
        many Emperors were killed.
</pre>
    An event considered as extended in time and cyclic or
    repetitive is called an “activity”. The abstractor “zu'o”
    means “activity-of”: 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>  mi tatpi ri'a le zu'o mi plipe
    I am-tired because-of the activity-of (I jump)
    I am tired because I jump.
</pre>
    An event considered as something that is either happening or
    not happening, with sharp boundaries, is called a “state”.
    The abstractor “za'i” means “state-of”: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">3.4)</a>  le za'i mi jmive cu ckape do
    the state-of (I am-alive) is-dangerous-to you
    My being alive is dangerous to you.
</pre>
    The abstractors in <a href="../3/#1">Examples 3.1</a> through
    <a href="../3/#4">3.4</a> could all have been replaced by “nu”,
    with some loss of precision. Note that Lojban allows every sort
    of event to be viewed in any of these four ways: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the “state of running” begins when the runner starts
      and ends when the runner stops;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the “activity of running” consists of the cycle “lift
      leg, step forward, drop leg, lift other leg...” (each such
      cycle is a process, but the activity consists in the
      repetition of the cycle);</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the “process of running” puts emphasis on the initial
      sprint, the steady speed, and the final slowdown;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the “achievement of running” is most alien to English,
      but sees the event of running as a single indivisible thing,
      like “Pheidippides’ run from Marathon to Athens” (the
      original marathon).</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Further information on types of events can be found in <a
    href=../12/>Section 12</a>.</p>

    <p>The four event type abstractors have the following place
    structures:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>“mu'e”: x1 is a point event of (the bridi) “pu'u”: x1
      is a process of (the bridi) with stages x2 “za'i”: x1 is a
      continuous state of (the bridi) being true “zu'o”: x1 is an
      activity of (the bridi) consisting of repeated actions
      x2</dd>
    </dl>
