          <h3>7. Predication/sentence abstraction</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<pre>
     du'u    NU                  predication abstraction
</pre>
</p>

    <p>There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a
    sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a
    whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”,
    and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing,
    learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English
    sentence: 

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>   I know that Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    How’s that in Lojban? Let us try:

<pre>
<a id="2"
name="2">7.2)</a>   mi djuno le nu la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the event of Frank being a fool.
</pre>

    Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical,
    and can’t be contained inside one’s mind, except for events of
    thinking, feeling, and the like; <a href="../7/#2">Example
    7.2</a> comes close to claiming that Frank’s being-a-fool is
    purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact,
    <a href="../7/#2">Example 7.2</a> is an instance of improperly
    marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in <a
    href=../10/>Section 10</a>).</p>

    <p>Try again:

<pre>
<a id="3"
name="3">7.3)</a>   mi djuno le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.
</pre>

    Closer. <a href="../7/#3">Example 7.3</a> says that I know
    whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn’t say that he is one,
    as <a href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a> does. To catch that nuance,
    we must say:

<pre>
<a id="4"
name="4">7.4)</a>   mi djuno le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the predication that Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a
    fool” is not a property of “le du'u” abstraction, but of
    “djuno”; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result,
    “djuno” like “jei” has a place for epistemology, which
    specifies how we know.) <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a> has no
    such implied assertion:

<pre>
<a id="5"
name="5">7.5)</a>   mi kucli le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    and here “du'u” could probably be replaced by “jei” without
    much change in meaning: 

<pre>
<a id="6"
name="6">7.6)</a>   mi kucli le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I am curious about how true it is
             that Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity,
    “du'u” has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece
    of language) expressing the bridi: 

<pre>
       x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
</pre>

    and “le se du'u ...” is very useful in filling places of
    selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic
    behavior regarding bridi: 

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">7.7)</a>   la djan. cusku
             le se du'u
                 la djordj. klama le zarci [kei]
       John expresses
             the sentence-expressing-that
                 George goes-to the store
       John says that George goes to the store.
</pre>

    <a href="../7/#7">Example 7.7</a> differs from 

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">7.8)</a>   la djan cusku
             lu la djordj. klama le zarci li'u
       John expresses,
             quote, George goes to the store, unquote.
       John says “George goes to the store”.
</pre>

    because <a href="../7/#8">Example 7.8</a> claims that John
    actually said the quoted words, whereas <a href="../7/#7">Example
    7.6</a> claims only that he said some words or other which were
    to the same purpose.</p>

    <p>“le se du'u” is much the same as “lu'e le du'u”, a
    symbol for the predication, but “se du'u” can be used as a
    selbri, whereas “lu'e” is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See <a
    href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a> for a discussion of
    “lu'e”.)</p>
