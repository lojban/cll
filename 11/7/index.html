<h3>7. Predication/sentence abstraction</h3>
<p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     du'u    NU                  predication abstraction
</pre>
<p>There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">7.1)</a>   I know that Frank is a fool.
</pre>
How’s that in Lojban? Let us try:
<pre>
<a id="e2" name="e2">7.2)</a>   mi djuno le nu la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the event of Frank being a fool.
</pre>
Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can’t be contained inside one’s mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; <a href="../7/#e2">Example 7.2</a> comes close to claiming that Frank’s being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, <a href="../7/#e2">Example 7.2</a> is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in <a href="../10/">Section 10</a>).
<p>Try again:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3" name="e3">7.3)</a>   mi djuno le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.
</pre>
Closer. <a href="../7/#e3">Example 7.3</a> says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn’t say that he is one, as <a href="../7/#e1">Example 7.1</a> does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
<pre>
<a id="e4" name="e4">7.4)</a>   mi djuno le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I know the predication that Frank is a fool.
</pre>
Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of “le du'u” abstraction, but of “djuno”; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, “djuno” like “jei” has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) <a href="../7/#e5">Example 7.5</a> has no such implied assertion:
<pre>
<a id="e5" name="e5">7.5)</a>   mi kucli le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.
</pre>
and here “du'u” could probably be replaced by “jei” without much change in meaning:
<pre>
<a id="e6" name="e6">7.6)</a>   mi kucli le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
       I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.
</pre>
As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, “du'u” has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
<pre>
       du'u: x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
</pre>
and “le se du'u ...” is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
<pre>
<a id="e7" name="e7">7.7)</a>   la djan. cusku le se du'u la djordj. klama le zarci [kei]
       John expresses the sentence-expressing-that George goes-to the store
       John says that George goes to the store.
</pre>
<a href="../7/#e7">Example 7.7</a> differs from
<pre>
<a id="e8" name="e8">7.8)</a>   la djan cusku lu la djordj. klama le zarci li'u
       John expresses, quote, George goes to the store, unquote.
       John says “George goes to the store”.
</pre>
because <a href="../7/#e8">Example 7.8</a> claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas <a href="../7/#e7">Example 7.7</a> claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
<p>“le se du'u” is much the same as “lu'e le du'u”, a symbol for the predication, but “se du'u” can be used as a selbri, whereas “lu'e” is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See <a href="../../6/1/">Chapter 6</a> for a discussion of “lu'e”.)</p>
