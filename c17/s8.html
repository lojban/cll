          <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. What about Chinese characters?</h3>

    <p>Chinese characters (``han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>'' in
    Chinese, ``kanji'' in Japanese) represent an entirely different
    approach to writing from alphabets or syllabaries. (A
    syllabary, such as Japanese hiragana or Amharic writing, has
    one lerfu for each syllable of the spoken language.) Very
    roughly, Chinese characters represent single elements of
    meaning; also very roughly, they represent single syllables of
    spoken Chinese. There is in principle no limit to the number of
    Chinese characters that can exist, and many thousands are in
    regular use.</p>

    <p>It is hopeless for Lojban, with its limited lerfu and shift
    words, to create an alphabet which will match this diversity.
    However, there are various possible ways around the
    problem.</p>

    <p>First, both Chinese and Japanese have standard
    Latin-alphabet representations, known as ``pinyin'' for Chinese
    and ``romaji'' for Japanese, and these can be used. Thus, the
    word ``han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>'' is conventionally
    written with two characters, but it may be spelled out as:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  .y'y.bu .abu ny. vo zy. .ibu vo
    ``h'' ``a'' ``n'' 4 ``z'' ``i'' 4
</pre>
    The cmavo ``vo'' is the Lojban digit ``4''. It is grammatical
    to intersperse digits (of selma'o PA) into a string of lerfu
    words; as long as the first cmavo is a lerfu word, the whole
    will be interpreted as a string of lerfu words. In Chinese, the
    digits can be used to represent tones. Pinyin is more usually
    written using accent marks, the mechanism for which was
    explained in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>. 

    <p>The Japanese company named ``Mitsubishi'' in English is
    spelled the same way in romaji, and could be spelled out in
    Lojban thus:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d2"
name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  my. .ibu ty. sy. .ubu by. .ibu sy. .y'y.bu .ibu
    ``m'' ``i'' ``t'' ``s'' ``u'' ``b'' ``i'' ``s'' ``h'' ``i''
</pre>
    Alternatively, a really ambitious Lojbanist could assign lerfu
    words to the individual strokes used to write Chinese
    characters (there are about seven or eight of them if you are a
    flexible human being, or about 40 if you are a rigid computer
    program), and then represent each character with a ``tei'', the
    stroke lerfu words in the order of writing (which is
    standardized for each character), and a ``foi''. No one has as
    yet attempted this project.
