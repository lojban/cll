          <h3>6. Vague intervals and non-specific tenses</h3>

    <p>What is the significance of failing to specify an interval
    size of the type discussed in <a href=../5/>Section 5</a>? The
    Lojban rule is that if no interval size is given, the size of
    the space or time interval is left vague by the speaker. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">6.1)</a>  mi pu klama le zarci
    I [past] go-to the market.
</pre>
    really means: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>At a moment in the past, and possibly other moments as
      well, the event “I went to the market” was in
      progress.</dd>
    </dl>
    The vague or unspecified interval contains an instant in the
    speaker’s past. However, there is no indication whether or not
    the whole interval is in the speaker’s past! It is entirely
    possible that the interval during which the going-to-the-market
    is happening stretches into the speaker’s present or even
    future. 

    <p><a href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a> points up a fundamental
    difference between Lojban tenses and English tenses. An English
    past-tense sentence like “I went to the market” generally
    signifies that the going-to-the-market is entirely in the past;
    that is, that the event is complete at the time of speaking.
    Lojban “pu” has no such implication.</p>

    <p>This property of a past tense is sometimes called
    “aorist”, in reference to a similar concept in the tense
    system of Classical Greek. All of the Lojban tenses have the
    same property, however:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>  le tricu ba crino
    the tree [future] is-green
    The tree will be green.
</pre>
    does not imply (as the colloquial English translation does)
    that the tree is not green now. The vague interval throughout
    which the tree is, in fact, green may have already started. 

    <p>This general principle does not mean that Lojban has no way
    of indicating that a tree will be green but is not yet green.
    Indeed, there are several ways of expressing that concept: see
    <a href=../10/>Section 10</a> (event contours) and <a
    href=../20/>Section 20</a> (logical connection between
    tenses).</p>
