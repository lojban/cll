<h3>7. Dimensionality: VIhA</h3>
<p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     vi'i    VIhA                on a line
     vi'a    VIhA                in an area
     vi'u    VIhA                through a volume
     vi'e    VIhA                throughout a space/time interval
</pre>
<p>The cmavo of ZEhA are sufficient to express time intervals. One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify that a motion “in a small space” is more specifically “in a short line”, “in a small area”, or “through a small volume”.</p>
<p>What about the child walking on the ice in <a href="../5/#e1">Examples 5.1</a> through <a href="../5/#e3">5.3</a>? Given the nature of ice, probably the area interpretation is most sensible. I can make this assumption explicit with the appropriate member of selma'o VIhA:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1" name="e1">7.1)</a>   le verba ve'a vi'a cadzu le bisli
       The child [medium space interval] [2-dimensional] walks-on the ice.
       In a medium-sized area, the child walks on the ice.
</pre>
Space intervals can contain either VEhA or VIhA or both, but if both, VEhA must come first, as <a href="../7/#e1">Example 7.1</a> shows.
<p>The reader may wish to raise a philosophical point here. (Readers who don’t wish to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called “vi'a”, because relatively speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface. Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a single mountain) would be properly described with “vi'u”. So the cognitive, rather than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.</p>
<p>VIhA has a member “vi'e” which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time considered as an Einsteinian whole. (There are presently no cmavo of FAhA assigned to “pastward” and “futureward” considered as space rather than time directions — they could be added, though, if Lojbanists find space-time expression useful.) If a temporal tense cmavo is used in the same tense construct with a “vi'e” interval, the resulting tense may be self-contradictory.</p>
