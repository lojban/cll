          <h3>5. Interval sizes: VEhA and ZEhA</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     ve'i    VEhA                short space interval
     ve'a    VEhA                medium space interval
     ve'u    VEhA                long space interval

     ze'i    ZEhA                short time interval
     ze'a    ZEhA                medium time interval
     ze'u    ZEhA                long time interval
</pre>
</p>

    <p>So far, we have considered only events that are usually thought
    of as happening at a particular point in space and time: a man
    biting a dog at a specified place and time. But Lojbanic events
    may be much more “spread out” than that: “mi vasxu” (I
    breathe) is something which is true during the whole of my life
    from birth to death, and over the entire part of the earth
    where I spend my life. The cmavo of VEhA (for space) and ZEhA
    (for time) can be added to any of the tense constructs we have
    already studied to specify the size of the space or length of
    the time over which the bridi is claimed to be true. 

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>   le verba ve'i cadzu le bisli
       The child [small space interval] walks-on the ice.
       In a small space, the child walks on the ice.
       The child walks about a small area of the ice.
</pre>

    means that her walking was done in a small area. Like the
    distances, the interval sizes are classified only roughly as
    “small, medium, large”, and are relative to the context: a
    small part of a room might be a large part of a table in that
    room.</p>

    <p>Here is an example using a time interval:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>   le verba ze'a cadzu le bisli
       The child [medium time interval] walks-on the ice.
       For a medium time, the child walks/walked/will walk on the ice.
</pre>

    Note that with no time direction word, <a href="../5/#2">Example
    5.2</a> does not say when the walking happened: that would be
    determined by context. It is possible to specify both
    directions or distances and an interval, in which case the
    interval always comes afterward:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>   le verba pu ze'a cadzu le bisli
       The child [past] [medium time interval] walks-on the ice.
       For a medium time, the child walked on the ice.
       The child walked on the ice for a while.
</pre>

    In <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a>, the relationship of the
    interval to the specified point in time or space is
    indeterminate. Does the interval start at the point, end at the
    point, or is it centered on the point? By adding an additional
    direction cmavo after the interval, this question can be
    conclusively answered:

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">5.4)</a>   mi ca ze'ica cusku dei
       I [present] [short time interval &ndash; present] express this-utterance.
       I am now saying this sentence.
</pre>

    means that for an interval starting a short time in the past
    and extending to a short time in the future, I am expressing
    the utterance which is <a href="../5/#4">Example 5.4</a>. Of
    course, “short” is relative, as always in tenses. Even a long
    sentence takes up only a short part of a whole day; in a
    geological context, the era of Homo sapiens would only be a
    “ze'i” interval.</p>

    <p>By contrast,

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>   mi ca ze'ipu cusku dei
       I [present] [short time interval &ndash; past] express this-utterance.
       I have just been saying this sentence.

</pre>
    means that for a short time interval extending from the past to
    the present I have been expressing <a href="../5/#5">Example
    5.5</a>. Here the imaginary journey starts at the present, lays
    down one end point of the interval, moves into the past, and
    lays down the other endpoint. Another example: 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">5.6)</a>   mi pu ze'aba citka le mi sanmi
       I [past] [medium time interval - future] eat my meal.
       For a medium time afterward, I ate my meal.
       I ate my meal for a while.
</pre>

    With “ca” instead of “ba”, <a href="../5/#6">Example
    5.6</a> becomes <a href="../5/#7">Example 5.7</a>,

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">5.7)</a>   mi pu ze'aca citka le mi sanmi
       I [past] [medium time interval &ndash; present] eat my meal.
       For a medium time before and afterward, I ate my meal.
       I ate my meal for a while.
</pre>

    because the interval would then be centered on the past moment
    rather than oriented toward the future of that moment. The
    colloquial English translations are the same &mdash; English is not
    well-suited to representing this distinction.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of the use of space intervals with
    and without specified directions:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">5.8)</a>   ta ri'u ve'i finpe
       That-there [right] [short space interval] is-a-fish.
       That thing on my right is a fish.
</pre>

    In <a href="../5/#8">Example 5.8</a>, there is no equivalent
    in the colloquial English translation of the “small interval”
    which the fish occupies. Neither the Lojban nor the English
    expresses the orientation of the fish. Compare <a
    href="../5/#9">Example 5.9</a>:

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">5.9)</a>   ta ri'u ve'ica'u finpe
       That-there [right] [short space interval &ndash; front] is-a-fish.
       That thing on my right extending forwards is a fish.
</pre>

    Here the space interval occupied by the fish extends from a
    point on my right to another point in front of the first
    point.</p>
