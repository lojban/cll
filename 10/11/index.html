          <h3><a id="11" name="11">11. Space interval modifiers: FEhE</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
       fe'e    FEhE    space interval modifier flag
</pre>
    Like time intervals, space intervals can also be continuous,
    discontinuous, or repetitive. Rather than having a whole
    separate set of selma'o for space interval properties, we
    instead prefix the flag ``fe'e'' to the cmavo used for time
    interval properties. A space interval property would be placed
    just after the space interval size and/or dimensionality cmavo:
    

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-1" name="11-1">11.1)</a>    ko vi'i fe'e di'i
        sombo le gurni
    You-imperative [1-dimensional] [space:] [regularly]
        sow the grain.
    Sow the grain in a line and evenly!
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="11-2" name="11-2">11.2)</a>    mi fe'e ciroi
        tervecnu lo selsalta
    I [space:] [three places]
        buy those-which-are salad-ingredients.
    I buy salad ingredients in three locations.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="11-3" name="11-3">11.3)</a>    ze'e roroi ve'e
        fe'e roroi ku
        li re su'i re du li vo
    [whole time] [all times] [whole space]
        [space:] [all places]
        The-number 2 + 2 = the-number 4.
    Always and everywhere, two plus two is four.
</pre>

    <p>As shown in <a href="#11-3">Example 11.3</a>, when a tense
    comes first in a bridi, rather than in its normal position
    before the selbri (in this case ``du''), it is emphasized.</p>

    <p>The ``fe'e'' marker can also be used for the same purpose
    before members of ZAhO. (The cmavo ``be'a'' belongs to selma'o
    FAhA; it is the space direction meaning ``north of''.)</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-4" name="11-4">11.4)</a>    tu ve'abe'a
        fe'e co'a rokci
    that-yonder [medium space interval - north]
        [space] [initiative] is-a-rock.
    That is the beginning of a rock extending to my north.
    That is the south face of a rock.
</pre>
    Here the notion of a ``beginning point'' represented by the
    cmavo ``co'a'' is transferred from ``beginning in time'' to
    ``beginning in space'' under the influence of the ``fe'e''
    flag. Space is not inherently oriented, unlike time, which
    flows from past to future: therefore, some indication of
    orientation is necessary, and the ``ve'abe'a'' provides an
    orientation in which the south face is the ``beginning'' and
    the north face is the ``end'', since the rock extends from
    south (near me) to north (away from me). 

    <p>Many natural languages represent time by a space-based
    metaphor: in English, what is past is said to be ``behind us''.
    In other languages, the metaphor is reversed. Here, Lojban is
    representing space (or space interval modifiers) by a
    time-based metaphor: the choice of a FAhA cmavo following a
    VEhA cmavo indicates which direction is mapped onto the future.
    (The choice of future rather than past is arbitrary, but
    convenient for English-speakers.)</p>

    <p>If both a TAhE (or ROI) and a ZAhO are present as space
    interval modifiers, the ``fe'e'' flag must be prefixed to
    each.</p>
