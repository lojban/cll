          <h3>3. Compound spatial tenses</h3>

    <p>Humph, says the reader: this talk of ``imaginary journeys''
    is all very well, but what's the point of it? --- ``zu'a''
    means ``on the left'' and ``vi'' means ``nearby'', and there's
    no more to be said. The imaginary-journey model becomes more
    useful when so-called compound tenses are involved. A compound
    tense is exactly like a simple tense, but has several FAhAs run
    together:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3-1"
name="3-1">3.1)</a>  le nanmu ga'u zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [up] [left] bites the dog.
</pre>
    The proper interpretation of <a href="../3/#1">Example 3.1</a> is
    that the imaginary journey has two stages: first move from the
    speaker's location upward, and then to the left. A translation
    might read: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Left of a place above me, the man bites the dog.</dd>
    </dl>
    (Perhaps the speaker is at the bottom of a manhole, and the
    dog-biting is going on at the edge of the street.) 

    <p>In the English translation, the keywords ``left'' and
    ``above'' occur in reverse order to the Lojban order. This
    effect is typical of what happens when we ``unfold'' Lojban
    compound tenses into their English equivalents, and shows why
    it is not very useful to try to memorize a list of Lojban tense
    constructs and their colloquial English equivalents.</p>

    <p>The opposite order also makes sense:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3-2"
name="3-2">3.2)</a>  le nanmu zu'a ga'u batci le gerku
    The man [left] [up] bites the dog.
    Above a place to the left of me, the man bites the dog.
</pre>
    In ordinary space, the result of going up and then to the left
    is the same as that of going left and then up, but such a
    simple relationship does not apply in all environments or to
    all directions: going south, then east, then north may return
    one to the starting point, if that point is the North Pole. 

    <p>Each direction can have a distance following:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>  le nanmu zu'avi ga'uvu
        batci le gerku
    The man [left] [short distance] [up] [long distance]
        bites the dog.
    Far above a place slightly to the left of me,
        the man bites the dog.
</pre>
    A distance can also come at the beginning of the tense
    construct, without any specified direction. (<a
    href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>, with VA alone, is really a
    special case of this rule when no directions at all follow.) 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">3.4)</a>  le nanmu vi zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [short distance] [left] bites the dog.
    Left of a place near me, the man bites the dog.
</pre>
    Any number of directions may be used in a compound tense, with
    or without specified distances for each: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">3.5)</a>  le nanmu ca'uvi ni'ava
        ri'uvu ne'i
        batci le gerku
    The man [front] [short] [down] [medium]
        [right] [long] [within]
        bites the dog.
    Within a place a long distance to the right
        of a place which is a medium distance downward
        from a place a short distance in front of me,
        the man bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Whew! It's a good thing tense constructs are optional:
    having to say all that could certainly be painful. Note,
    however, how much shorter the Lojban version of <a
    href="../3/#5">Example 3.5</a> is than the English version.</p>
