          <h3><a id="s14" name="s14">14. A few notes on variables</h3>

    <p>A variable may have a quantifier placed in front of it even
    though it has already been quantified explicitly or implicitly
    by a previous appearance, as in:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e14d1"
name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    ci da poi mlatu cu blaci .ije re da cu barda
    Three Xs which-are cats are white, and two Xs are big.
</pre>

    <p>What does <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> mean? The
    appearance of ``ci da'' quantifies ``da'' as referring to three
    things, which are restricted by the relative clause to be cats.
    When ``re da'' appears later, it refers to two of the those
    three things --- there is no saying which ones. Further uses of
    ``da'' alone, if there were any, would refer once more to the
    three cats, so the requantification of ``da'' is purely
    local.</p>

    <p>In general, the scope of a prenex that precedes a sentence
    extends to following sentences that are joined by ijeks
    (explained in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>) such as the
    ``.ije'' in <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a>. Theoretically, a
    bare ``.i'' terminates the scope of the prenex. Informally,
    however, variables may persist for a while even after an
    ``.i'', as if it were an ``.ije''. Prenexes that precede
    embedded bridi such as relative clauses and abstractions extend
    only to the end of the clause, as explained in <a
    href="#s8">Section 8</a>. A prenex preceding ``tu'e ... tu'u''
    long-scope brackets persists until the ``tu'u'', which may be
    many sentences or even paragraphs later.</p>

    <p>If the variables ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' (or the selbri
    variables ``bu'a'', ``bu'e'', and ``bu'i'') are insufficient in
    number for handling a particular problem, the Lojban approach
    is to add a subscript to any of them. Each possible different
    combination of a subscript and a variable cmavo counts as a
    distinct variable in Lojban. Subscripts are explained in full
    in <a href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter 19</a>, but in general consist
    of the cmavo ``xi'' (of selma'o XI) followed by a number, one
    or more lerfu words forming a single string, or a general
    mathematical expression enclosed in parentheses.</p>

    <p>A quantifier can be prefixed to a variable that has already
    been bound either in a prenex or earlier in the bridi,
    thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e14d2"
name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    ci da poi prenu cu se ralju pa da
    Three Xs which are-persons are-led-by one-of X
    Three people are led by one of them.
</pre>

    <p>The ``pa da'' in <a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a> does not
    specify the number of things to which ``da'' refers, as the
    preceding ``ci da'' does. Instead, it selects one of them for
    use in this sumti only. The number of referents of ``da''
    remains three, but a single one (there is no way of knowing
    which one) is selected to be the leader.</p>
