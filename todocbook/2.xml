  <title>Chapter 2 A Quick Tour of Lojban Grammar, With Diagrams</title>
  <section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1">
    <title>The concept of the bridi</title>
    <para>This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a 
    <quote>quick tour</quote>of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para>Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:</para>

    </example>
    <para>These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in English, we use the noun 
    <!-- ^^   John and Sam: example, 11 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>John and Sam</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>father</quote>to describe a static relationship in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example1" />, the verb 
    <quote>hits</quote>to describe an active relationship in 
    <!-- ^^   hits: example, 11 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>hits</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example2" />, and the adjective 
    <quote>taller</quote>to describe an attributive relationship in 
    <!-- ^^   taller: example, 11 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>taller</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example3" />. In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a 
    <quote>predication</quote>; in Lojban it is called a 
    <quote>bridi</quote>, and the central part of speech is the 
    <quote>selbri</quote>. Logicians refer to the things thus related as 
    <quote>arguments</quote>, while Lojbanists call them 
    <quote>sumti</quote>. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.</para>

    <para>In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English, for example,

    </example>
    <para>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by 
    <quote>give</quote>has not changed.</para>
    <para>In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known collectively as its 
    <quote>place structure</quote>. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a 
    <quote>gismu</quote>, and the definition in a dictionary gives the place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti places.</para>
    <para>This book uses the Lojban terms 
    <quote>bridi</quote>, 
    <quote>sumti</quote>, and 
    <quote>selbri</quote>, because it is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</para>
    <para>The Lojban examples in this chapter (but not in the rest of the book) use a single underline (---) under each sumti, and a double underline (===) under each selbri, to help you to tell them apart.</para>

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section2">
    <title>Pronunciation</title>
    <para>Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter3" />, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.</para>
    <para>Lojban has six recognized vowels: 
    <quote>a</quote>, 
    <quote>e</quote>, 
    <quote>i</quote>, 
    <quote>o</quote>, 
    <quote>u</quote>and 
    <quote>y</quote>. The first five are roughly pronounced as 
    <quote>a</quote>as in 
    <quote>father</quote>, 
    <quote>e</quote>as in 
    <quote>let</quote>, 
    <quote>i</quote>as in 
    <quote>machine</quote>, 
    <quote>o</quote>as in 
    <quote>dome</quote>and 
    <quote>u</quote>as in 
    <quote>flute</quote>. 
    <quote>y</quote>is pronounced as the sound called 
    <quote>schwa</quote>, that is, as the unstressed 
    <quote>a</quote>as in 
    <quote>about</quote>or 
    <quote>around</quote>.</para>
    <para>Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: 
    <quote>b</quote>, 
    <quote>d</quote>, 
    <quote>f</quote>, 
    <quote>k</quote>, 
    <quote>l</quote>, 
    <quote>m</quote>, 
    <quote>n</quote>, 
    <quote>p</quote>, 
    <quote>r</quote>, 
    <quote>t</quote>, 
    <quote>v</quote>and 
    <quote>z</quote>. The letter 
    <quote>c</quote>, on the other hand is pronounced as the 
    <quote>sh</quote>in 
    <quote>hush</quote>, while 
    <quote>j</quote>is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the 
    <quote>s</quote>in 
    <quote>pleasure</quote>. 
    <quote>g</quote>is always pronounced as it is in 
    <quote>gift</quote>, never as in 
    <quote>giant</quote>. 
    <quote>s</quote>is as in 
    <quote>sell</quote>, never as in 
    <quote>rose</quote>. The sound of 
    <quote>x</quote>is not found in English in normal words. It is found as 
    <quote>ch</quote>in Scottish 
    <quote>loch</quote>, as 
    <quote>j</quote>in Spanish 
    <quote>junta</quote>, and as 
    <quote>ch</quote>in German 
    <quote>Bach</quote>; it also appears in the English interjection 
    <quote>yecchh!</quote>. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter 
    <quote>r</quote>can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.</para>
    <para>The Lojban diphthongs 
    <quote>ai</quote>, 
    <quote>ei</quote>, 
    <quote>oi</quote>, and 
    <quote>au</quote>are pronounced much as in the English words 
    <quote>sigh</quote>, 
    <quote>say</quote>, 
    <quote>boy</quote>, and 
    <quote>how</quote>. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an 
    <quote>i</quote>pronounced like English 
    <quote>y</quote>(for example, 
    <quote>io</quote>is pronounced 
    <quote>yo</quote>) or else with a 
    <quote>u</quote>pronounced like English 
    <quote>w</quote>(for example, 
    <quote>ua</quote>is pronounced 
    <quote>wa</quote>).</para>
    <para>Lojban also has three 
    <quote>semi-letters</quote>: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter 
    <!-- ^^   glottal stop: as pause in Lojban, 31 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>glottal stop</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>h</quote>. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.</para>
    <para>Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is 
    <quote>y</quote>, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</para>
    <para>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.</para>

    <para>Each selbri (relation) has a specific rule that defines the role of each sumti in the bridi, based on its position. In the table above, that order was expressed by labeling the sumti positions as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.</para>
    <para>Like the table in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section3" />, this table is far from complete: in fact, no complete table can exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created (in specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing supply of words inadequate. This notion is a basic difference between Lojban (and some other languages such as German and Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very leery of using words that 
    <quote>aren't in the dictionary</quote>. Lojbanists are encouraged to invent new words; doing so is a major way of participating in the development of the language.

    <title>The basic structure of longer utterances</title>
    <para>People don't always say just one sentence. Lojban has a specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>and 
    <quote>.i</quote>. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.</para>
    <!-- ^^   punctuation marks: cmavo as Lojban equivalents, 50 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>punctuation marks</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>separates paragraphs (covering different topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>s, with perhaps 
    <quote>ni'oni'oni'o</quote>used to indicate a chapter, 
    <quote>ni'oni'o</quote>to indicate a section, and a single 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>.i</quote>separates sentences. It is sometimes compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The cmavo 
    <quote>xu</quote>, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15" />, is one such word - it turns the sentence from a statement to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will usually omit the 
    <quote>.i</quote>even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.</para>
    <para>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the 
    <quote>.i</quote>before continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good translation for 
    <quote>.i</quote>is the 
    <quote>and</quote>used in run-on sentences when people are talking informally: 
    <quote>I did this, and then I did that, and ..., and ...</quote>.</para>
