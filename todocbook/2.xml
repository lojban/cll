    <title>The concept of the bridi</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>bridi</primary><secondary>concept of</secondary></indexterm> This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a 
    <quote>quick tour</quote> of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</para>

However, in English, we use the noun 
    
    <quote>father</quote> to describe a static relationship in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qIuj"/>, the verb 
    <quote>hits</quote> to describe an active relationship in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qiuQ"/>, and the adjective 
    <quote>taller</quote> to describe an attributive relationship in 
    
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qIuS"/>. In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a 
    <quote>predication</quote>; in Lojban it is called a 
    <jbophrase>bridi</jbophrase>, and the central part of speech is the 
    <jbophrase>selbri</jbophrase>. Logicians refer to the things thus related as 
    <quote>arguments</quote>, while Lojbanists call them 
    <jbophrase>sumti</jbophrase>. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>give</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm> In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English, for example,

    <para>mean two different things because the relative positions of

        <jbo>The book gives John Sam.</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by 
    <quote>give</quote> has not changed.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>place structure</primary><secondary>definition of</secondary></indexterm> In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known collectively as its 
    <quote>place structure</quote>. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a 
    <jbophrase>gismu</jbophrase>, and the definition in a dictionary gives the place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti places.</para>
    <para>This book uses the Lojban terms 
    <jbophrase>bridi</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>sumti</jbophrase>, and 
    <jbophrase>selbri</jbophrase>, because it is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</para>

    <title>Pronunciation</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>pronunciation</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-phonology"/>, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>vowels</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> Lojban has six recognized vowels: 
    <quote>a</quote>, 
    <jbophrase>e</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>i</jbophrase>, 
    <quote>o</quote>, 
    <quote>u</quote> and 
    <jbophrase>y</jbophrase>. The first five are roughly pronounced as 
    <quote>a</quote> as in 
    <quote>father</quote>, 
    <jbophrase>e</jbophrase> as in 
    <quote>let</quote>, 
    <jbophrase>i</jbophrase> as in 
    <quote>machine</quote>, 
    <quote>o</quote> as in 
    <quote>dome</quote> and 
    <quote>u</quote> as in 
    <quote>flute</quote>. 
    <jbophrase>y</jbophrase> is pronounced as the sound called 
    <quote>schwa</quote>, that is, as the unstressed 
    <quote>a</quote> as in 
    <quote>about</quote> or 
    <quote>around</quote>.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>consonants</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: 
    <quote>b</quote>, 
    <quote>d</quote>, 
    <quote>f</quote>, 
    <quote>k</quote>, 
    <quote>l</quote>, 
    <quote>m</quote>, 
    <quote>n</quote>, 
    <quote>p</quote>, 
    <quote>r</quote>, 
    <quote>t</quote>, 
    <quote>v</quote> and 
    <jbophrase>z</jbophrase>. The letter 
    <quote>c</quote>, on the other hand is pronounced as the 
    <quote>sh</quote> in 
    <quote>hush</quote>, while 
    <quote>j</quote> is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the 
    <quote>s</quote> in 
    <quote>pleasure</quote>. 
    <jbophrase>g</jbophrase> is always pronounced as it is in 
    <quote>gift</quote>, never as in 
    <jbophrase>giant</jbophrase>. 
    <quote>s</quote> is as in 
    <quote>sell</quote>, never as in 
    <quote>rose</quote>. The sound of 
    <quote>x</quote> is not found in English in normal words. It is found as 
    <quote>ch</quote> in Scottish 
    <quote>loch</quote>, as 
    <quote>j</quote> in Spanish 
    <jbophrase>junta</jbophrase>, and as 
    <quote>ch</quote> in German 
    <quote>Bach</quote>; it also appears in the English interjection 
    <quote>yecchh!</quote>. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter 
    <quote>r</quote> can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>diphthongs</primary><secondary>pronunciation of</secondary><tertiary>quick-tour version</tertiary></indexterm> The Lojban diphthongs 
    <jbophrase>ai</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>ei</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>oi</jbophrase>, and 
    <jbophrase>au</jbophrase> are pronounced much as in the English words 
    <quote>sigh</quote>, 
    <quote>say</quote>, 
    <quote>boy</quote>, and 
    <quote>how</quote>. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an 
    <jbophrase>i</jbophrase> pronounced like English 
    <jbophrase>y</jbophrase> (for example, 
    <jbophrase>io</jbophrase> is pronounced 
    <quote>yo</quote>) or else with a 
    <quote>u</quote> pronounced like English 
    <quote>w</quote> (for example, 
    <jbophrase>ua</jbophrase> is pronounced 
    <quote>wa</quote>).</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>period</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>comma</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>apostrophe</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Lojban also has three 
    <quote>semi-letters</quote>: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter 
    
    <quote>h</quote>. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>stress</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is 
    <jbophrase>y</jbophrase>, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</para>
    <para>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>words not in the dictionary</primary></indexterm> Like the table in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section3"/>, this table is far from complete: in fact, no complete table can exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created (in specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing supply of words inadequate. This notion is a basic difference between Lojban (and some other languages such as German and Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very leery of using words that 
    <quote>aren't in the dictionary</quote>. Lojbanists are encouraged to invent new words; doing so is a major way of participating in the development of the language.

    <para>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which has become first in the sentence.

    <quote>Smoke!</quote> upon seeing smoke or smelling the odor, or

    <para>The word

    <quote>ve</quote> and 
    <quote>xe</quote> switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as 
    <quote>conversions</quote>, and the 
    <quote>se</quote>, 
    <quote>te</quote>, 
    <quote>ve</quote>, and 
    <quote>xe</quote> cmavo are said to convert the selbri.</para>
    <para>More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/> for details.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>passive voice</primary></indexterm> The effect is similar to what in English is called the 
    <quote>passive voice</quote>. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as

Lojban has a specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo 
    <jbophrase>ni'o</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>.i</jbophrase>. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.</para>
    
    <para>The cmavo 
    <jbophrase>ni'o</jbophrase> separates paragraphs (covering different topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple 
    <jbophrase>ni'o</jbophrase> s, with perhaps 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'oni'o</jbophrase> used to indicate a chapter, 
    <jbophrase>ni'oni'o</jbophrase> to indicate a section, and a single 
    <jbophrase>ni'o</jbophrase> to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <jbophrase>.i</jbophrase> separates sentences. It is sometimes compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The cmavo 
    <jbophrase>xu</jbophrase>, discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15"/>, is one such word - it turns the sentence from a statement to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will usually omit the 
    <jbophrase>.i</jbophrase> even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.</para>
    <para>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the 
    <jbophrase>.i</jbophrase> before continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good translation for 
    <jbophrase>.i</jbophrase> is the 
    <quote>and</quote> used in run-on sentences when people are talking informally: 
    <quote>I did this, and then I did that, and ..., and ...</quote>.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>talker</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>descriptions</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker, the listener and things we can point to. Let's say I want to talk about a talker other than 
    <jbophrase>mi</jbophrase>. What I want to talk about would naturally fit into the first place of 
    <jbophrase>tavla</jbophrase>. Lojban, it turns out, has an operator that pulls this first place out of a selbri and converts it to a sumti called a 
    <quote>description sumti</quote>. The description sumti 
    <jbophrase>le tavla ku</jbophrase> means 
    <quote>the talker</quote>, and may be used wherever any sumti may be used.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>questions</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> There are many kinds of questions in Lojban: full explanations appear in

    <jbophrase>ma</jbophrase> is used to create a sumti question: it indicates that the speaker wishes to know the sumti which should be placed at the location of the 
    <jbophrase>ma</jbophrase> to make the bridi true. It can be translated as 
    <quote>Who?</quote> or 
    <quote>What?</quote> in most cases, but also serves for 
    <quote>When?</quote>, 
    <quote>Where?</quote>, and 
    <quote>Why?</quote> when used in sumti places that express time, location, or cause. For example:</para>

    <quote>but</quote> and

    <para>necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag 
    <jbophrase>ca</jbophrase>. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the 
    <quote>cu</quote>, and they may make a 
    <quote>cu</quote> unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>space tenses</primary><secondary>quick-tour version</secondary></indexterm> Lojban also extends the notion of 
    <quote>tense</quote> to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag 
    <jbophrase>vu</jbophrase> to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:</para>
