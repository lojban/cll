    <para>Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ti</quote>if it is nearby, or 
    <quote>ta</quote>if it is somewhat further away, or 
    <quote>tu</quote>if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7" />.)</para>
    <para>However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</para>

      <interlinear-gloss>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>What is the referent of 
    <quote>ti</quote>? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for 
    <quote>ti</quote>can be plural as well as singular, and mean 
    <!-- ^^   plural: Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking, 120; Lojban equivalent of, 443; meaning of le with, 123 -->

      <primary>plural</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>these ones</quote>as well as 
    <quote>this one</quote>) the pores on the person's nose?</para>
    <para>To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a 
    <quote>relative clause</quote>. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>(of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, 
    <quote>noi</quote>is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote>, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.</para>
    <para>In between the 
    <quote>poi</quote>and the 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>(of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the 
    <quote>relativized sumti</quote>). Here are some examples before we go any further:</para>

    <para>In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word 
    <quote>IT</quote>, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example2" />through 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example4" />, the cmavo 
    <quote>ti</quote>) to which the relative clause is attached.</para>
    <para>Of course, there is no reason why 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:</para>

    <para>In

    <quote>ke'a</quote>appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter11" />) within a relative clause.</para>
    <para>Like any sumti, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:</para>

    <para>almost certainly means the same thing as 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example3" />. However, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:</para>

    <para>As stated before,

    <quote>ku'o</quote>will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example2" />can be written:</para>

    <para>There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by

    <quote>poi</quote>, and incidental (sometimes called simply 
    <quote>non-restrictive</quote>) relative clauses introduced by 
    <quote>noi</quote>. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1" />are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)</para>

    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example1" />, the information conveyed by 
    <quote>poi blanu</quote>is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why 
    <quote>poi</quote>relative clauses are called restrictive. In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example2" />, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause 
    <quote>noi blanu</quote>just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</para>
    <para>In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by 
    <!-- ^^   tone of voice, 297 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>tone of voice</primary>

    <quote>that</quote>as well as 
    <quote>which</quote>and 
    <quote>who</quote>, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with 
    <quote>that</quote>. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote>and 
    <quote>noi</quote>rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.</para>

    <para>There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.</para>

    <para>In

    <para>The most usual translation of

    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section4-example2" />, the restrictive clause 
    <quote>poi blabi</quote>specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause 
    <quote>noi le mi pendo cu ponse</quote>is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the 
    <quote>poi blabi</quote>. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.</para>
    <para>It is also possible to connect relative phrases with

    <title>Relative clauses and descriptors</title>
    <para>So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.</para>
    <para>There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor ( 
    <quote>le</quote>, 
    <quote>lo</quote>, or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is 
    <quote>ku</quote>), and after the 
    <quote>ku</quote>. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section5-example1" />, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:</para>
    <!-- ^^   elidable terminators: list, 486 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>elidable terminators</primary>

        <en>The dog which is white is going.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>is the terminator paired with 
    <quote>poi</quote>and 
    <quote>ku</quote>with 
    <quote>le</quote>, and 
    <quote>vau</quote>is the terminator of the whole bridi.</para>
    <para>When a simple descriptor using 
    <quote>le</quote>, like 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>, has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to

    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example1" />will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example2" />, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example2" />, the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause ( 
    <quote>blabi</quote>) will merge with the selbri of the description ( 
    <quote>gerku</quote>), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example3" />will be apparent shortly.</para>
    <para>As is explained in detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />, two different numbers (known as the 
    <quote>inner quantifier</quote>and the 
    <quote>outer quantifier</quote>) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example7" />means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, as in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example7" />, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no 
    <quote>ku</quote>, or if the relative clause comes before an explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.</para>
    <para>What about

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />. Thus 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>is taken to mean 
    <quote>all of the things I refer to as dogs</quote>, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the

    <quote>ro</quote>(meaning

    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example8" />, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example9" />, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning 
    <quote>First take all persons - by the way, they're all white</quote>. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.</para>

    <para>When the descriptor is

    <para>A possessive sumti may also have regular relative clauses attached to it.

    <title>Relative clauses in vocative phrases</title>
    <para>Vocative phrases are explained in more detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />. Briefly, they are a method of indicating who a sentence or discourse is addressed to: of identifying the intended listener. They take three general forms, all beginning with cmavo from selma'o COI or DOI (called 
    <quote>vocative words</quote>; there can be one or many), followed by either a name, a selbri, or a sumti. Here are three examples:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example2" />says farewell to something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named 
    <quote>Horse</quote>. In a sense, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example2" />is ambiguous between 
    <quote>co'o le xirma</quote>and 
    <quote>co'o la xirma</quote>, a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in general: saying 
    <quote>George</quote>doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.</para>
    <para>Similarly, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example1" />can be thought of as an abbreviation of:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example1" />to 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example3" />, as sentences by themselves.</para>
    <para>As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to that of sumti, and as you might expect, vocative phrases allow relative clauses in various places. In vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative clauses must come just after the names:</para>

    <para>A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative clauses either before or after the selbri; both forms have the same meaning. Here are some examples:</para>

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter8-section10">
    <title>Relative clauses within relative clauses</title>
    <para>For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-TGiu">
      <title>

        <en>The person who is-in the room which is-blue is-slow.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>However, an ambiguity can exist if 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>:</para>

        </indexterm>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here, the meaning of 
    <quote>IT-sub-2</quote>is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, 
    <quote>ke'axipa</quote>(IT-sub-1) means the same as plain
