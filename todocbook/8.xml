  <title>Chapter 8 Relative Clauses, Which Make sumti Even More Complicated</title>

    <title>1. What are you pointing at?</title>
    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

</programlisting>
    <para>Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ti</quote>if it is nearby, or 
    <quote>ta</quote>if it is somewhat further away, or 
    <quote>tu</quote>if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7" />.)</para>
    <para>However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</para>

    </example>
    <para>What is the referent of 
    <quote>ti</quote>? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for 
    <quote>ti</quote>can be plural as well as singular, and mean 
    <quote>these ones</quote>as well as 
    <quote>this one</quote>) the pores on the person's nose?</para>
    <para>To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a 
    <quote>relative clause</quote>. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>(of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, 
    <quote>noi</quote>is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote>, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.</para>
    <para>In between the 
    <quote>poi</quote>and the 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>(of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the 
    <quote>relativized sumti</quote>). Here are some examples before we go any further:</para>

    <para>In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word 
    <quote>IT</quote>, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example2" />through 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1-example4" />, the cmavo 
    <quote>ti</quote>) to which the relative clause is attached.</para>
    <para>Of course, there is no reason why 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:</para>

    <para>Like any sumti, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:</para>

    <title>2. Incidental relative clauses</title>
    <para>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
     noi     NOI                 incidental relative clause introducer
</programlisting>
    <para>There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by 
    <quote>poi</quote>, and incidental (sometimes called simply 
    <quote>non-restrictive</quote>) relative clauses introduced by 
    <quote>noi</quote>. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1" />are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)</para>
    <para>Consider the following examples:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-IU0R">

        <en>The dog which is blue is large.</en>
        <jbo>le gerku noi blanu cu barda</jbo>
        <gloss>The dog incidentally-which is-blue is-large.</gloss>
        <en>The dog, which is blue, is large.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example1" />, the information conveyed by 
    <quote>poi blanu</quote>is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why 
    <quote>poi</quote>relative clauses are called restrictive. In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example2" />, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause 
    <quote>noi blanu</quote>just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</para>
    <para>In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by 
    <quote>that</quote>as well as 
    <quote>which</quote>and 
    <quote>who</quote>, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with 
    <quote>that</quote>. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote>and 
    <quote>noi</quote>rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.</para>
    <para>Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In this example, 
    <quote>mi</quote>is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example4" />, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since 
    <quote>le karce</quote>can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example5" />with a restrictive relative clause:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-0qU1">

        <gloss>Do you see my car that is white?</gloss>
        <en>Do you see my white car?</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti 
    <quote>le mi karce</quote>(and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example5" />means much the same as 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example6" />, which does not use a relative clause:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-zsQ6">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e2d6" />

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>xu do viska le mi blabi karce</jbo>
        <gloss>[True?] You see my white car.</gloss>
        <en>Do you see my car, the white one?</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, 
    <quote>blabi karce</quote>, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section2-example5" />can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.</para>

    <title>3. Relative phrases</title>
    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

    <para>There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example1" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example2" />: the chair is more permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible) contrast between 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example1" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example3" />is that 
    <quote>pe mi</quote>would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and 
    <quote>po mi</quote>for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).</para>
    <para>As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by 
    <quote>po</quote>is usually called 
    <quote>possession</quote>, although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (

    <quote>intrinsic</quote>and 
    <quote>extrinsic</quote>, or sometimes 
    <quote>inalienable</quote>and 
    <quote>alienable</quote>, respectively. Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example5" />, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of degree.)</para>
    <para>By contrast, the bottle of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example7" />can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the 
    <quote>inalienable rights</quote>of men, but just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to culture.</para>
    <para>Note that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section3-example5" />can also be expressed without a relative clause:</para>

    <quote>ge'u</quote>of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit 
    <quote>ge'u</quote>is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in

    <quote>le gerku</quote>, has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example1" />will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example2" />, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example2" />, the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote>must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (
    <quote>blabi</quote>) will merge with the selbri of the description (
    <quote>gerku</quote>), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example3" />will be apparent shortly.</para>
    <para>As is explained in detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />, two different numbers (known as the 
    <quote>inner quantifier</quote>and the 
    <quote>outer quantifier</quote>) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,</para>

    <para>As the parentheses show, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example6" />means that all five of the persons are women, whereas 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example7" />means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, as in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example7" />, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no 
    <quote>ku</quote>, or if the relative clause comes before an explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.</para>
    <para>What about 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example5" />? By convention, it means the same as 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example7" />, and it requires no

    <para>When 
    <quote>le</quote>is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be 
    <quote>ro</quote>(meaning

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />. Thus 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>is taken to mean 
    <quote>all of the things I refer to as dogs</quote>, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the 
    <quote>ku</quote>or before it. However, if the descriptor is 
    <quote>lo</quote>, the difference is quite important:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Both 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example8" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example9" />tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does 
    <quote>lo prenu noi blabi</quote>mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is 
    <quote>ro</quote>(meaning 
    <quote>all</quote>), and the default outer quantifier is 
    <quote>su'o</quote>(meaning 
    <quote>at least one</quote>). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.</para>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example8" />, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section6-example9" />, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning 
    <quote>First take all persons - by the way, they're all white</quote>. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.</para>
    <para>The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use 
    <quote>ku</quote>when attaching a 
    <quote>noi</quote>relative clause to a 
    <quote>lo</quote>descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.</para>
    <para>When the descriptor is 
    <quote>la</quote>, indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the 
    <quote>ku</quote>, whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the 
    <quote>ku</quote>is not. Therefore,</para>

    <para>means the same thing as well. A sumti like the one in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section7-example1" />is called a 
    <quote>possessive sumti</quote>. Of course, it does not really indicate possession in the sense of ownership, but like 
    <quote>pe</quote>relative phrases, indicates only weak association; you can say 
    <quote>le mi karce</quote>even if you've only borrowed it for the night. (In English, 
    <quote>my car</quote>usually means 
    <quote>le karce po mi</quote>, but we do not have the same sense of possession in 
    <quote>my seat on the bus</quote>; Lojban simply makes the weaker sense the standard one.) The inner sumti, 
    <quote>mi</quote>in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section7-example1" />, is correspondingly called the 
    <quote>possessor sumti</quote>.</para>
    <para>Historically, possessive sumti existed before any other kind of relative phrase or clause, and were retained when the machinery of relative phrases and clauses as detailed in this chapter so far was slowly built up. When preposed relative clauses of the 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section7-example2" />type were devised, possessive sumti were most easily viewed as a special case of them.</para>
    <para>Although any sumti, however complex, can appear in a full-fledged relative phrase, only simple sumti can appear as possessor sumti, without a 
    <quote>pe</quote>. Roughly speaking, the legal possessor sumti are: pro-sumti, quotations, names and descriptions, and numbers. In addition, the possessor sumti may not be preceded by a quantifier, as such a form would be interpreted as the unusual 
    <quote>descriptor + quantifier + sumti</quote>type of description. All these sumti forms are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />.</para>
    <para>Here is an example of a description used in a possessive sumti:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-rBmw">

        <en>The man's car is blue.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note the explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>at the end of the possessor sumti, which prevents the selbri of the possessor sumti from merging with the selbri of the main description sumti. Because of the need for this 
    <quote>ku</quote>, the most common kind of possessor sumti are pro-sumti, especially personal pro-sumti, which require no elidable terminator. Descriptions are more likely to be attached with relative phrases.</para>
    <para>And here is a number used as a possessor sumti:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-pYfN">

    <para>which is not quite the same as 
    <quote>the fifth juror</quote>; it simply indicates a weak association between the particular juror and the number 5.</para>
    <para>A possessive sumti may also have regular relative clauses attached to it. This would need no comment if it were not for the following special rule: a relative clause immediately following the possessor sumti is understood to affect the possessor sumti, not the possessive.

    <para>and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants. Note the required 
    <quote>lu'u</quote>terminator, which prevents the relative clause from attaching to the quotation itself: we do not wish to refer to an old quotation!</para>
    <para>Sometimes, however, it is important to make a relative clause apply to the whole of a more complex sumti, one which involves logical or non-logical connection (explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14" />). For example,</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-EYgE">

        <en>Frank and George, who is a man, go to the house.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The incidental claim in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section8-example5" />is not that Frank and George are men, but only that George is a man, because the incidental relative clause attaches only to 
    <quote>la djordj</quote>, the immediately preceding simple sumti.</para>
    <para>To make a relative clause attach to both parts of the logically connected sumti in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section8-example5" />, a new cmavo is needed, 
    <quote>vu'o</quote>(of selma'o VUhO). It is placed between the sumti and the relative clause, and extends the sphere of influence of that relative clause to the entire preceding sumti, including however many logical or non-logical connectives there may be.</para>

        <en>Frank and George, who are men, go to the house.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The presence of 
    <quote>vu'o</quote>here means that the relative clause 
    <quote>noi nanmu</quote>extends to the entire logically connected sumti 
    <quote>la frank. .e la djordj.</quote>; in other words, both Frank and George are claimed to be men, as the colloquial translation shows.</para>
    <para>English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the case of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section8-example5" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section8-example6" />by making use of number: 
    <quote>who is</quote>rather than 
    <quote>who are</quote>. Lojban doesn't distinguish between singular and plural verbs: 
    <quote>nanmu</quote>can mean 
    <quote>is a man</quote>or 
    <quote>are men</quote>, so another means is required. Furthermore, Lojban's mechanism works correctly in general: if 
    <quote>nanmu</quote>(meaning 
    <quote>is-a-man</quote>) were replaced with 
    <quote>pu bajra</quote>(
    <quote>ran</quote>), English would have to make the distinction some other way:</para>

    <title>9. Relative clauses in vocative phrases</title>
    <para>Vocative phrases are explained in more detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />. Briefly, they are a method of indicating who a sentence or discourse is addressed to: of identifying the intended listener. They take three general forms, all beginning with cmavo from selma'o COI or DOI (called 
    <quote>vocative words</quote>; there can be one or many), followed by either a name, a selbri, or a sumti. Here are three examples:</para>

        <jbo>coi. frank.</jbo>
        <en>Hello, Frank.</en>
        <jbo>co'o xirma</jbo>
        <en>Goodbye, horse.</en>
        <jbo>fi'i la frank. .e la djordj.</jbo>
        <en>Welcome, Frank and George!</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example2" />says farewell to something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named 
    <quote>Horse</quote>. In a sense, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example2" />is ambiguous between 
    <quote>co'o le xirma</quote>and 
    <quote>co'o la xirma</quote>, a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in general: saying 
    <quote>George</quote>doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.</para>
    <para>Similarly, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example1" />can be thought of as an abbreviation of:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-oWPU">

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>coi la frank.</jbo>
        <en>Hello, the-one-named 
        <quote>Frank</quote>.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example1" />to 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example3" />, as sentences by themselves.</para>
    <para>As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to that of sumti, and as you might expect, vocative phrases allow relative clauses in various places. In vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative clauses must come just after the names:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-xECX">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e9d5" />

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>coi. frank. poi xunre se bende</jbo>
        <gloss>Hello, Frank who is-a-red team-member</gloss>
        <en>Hello, Frank from the Red Team!</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The restrictive relative clause in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example5" />suggests that there is some other Frank (perhaps on the Green Team) from whom this Frank, the one the speaker is greeting, must be distinguished.</para>
    <para>A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative clauses either before or after the selbri; both forms have the same meaning. Here are some examples:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-Aa7B">
      <title>

    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example6" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section9-example7" />mean the same thing. In fact, relative clauses can appear in both places.</para>

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter8-section10">
    <title>10. Relative clauses within relative clauses</title>
    <para>For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-TGiu">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e10d1" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter8-section10-example1" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le prenu poi zvati le kumfa poi blanu cu masno</jbo>
        <en>The person who is-in the room which is-blue is-slow.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>However, an ambiguity can exist if 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-8RdM">
      <title>

      <interlinear-gloss>

        <gloss>The person who is-in the room which IT-sub-2 built IT is-slow.</gloss>
        <en>The person who is in the room which he built is slow.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here, the meaning of 
    <quote>IT-sub-2</quote>is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, 
    <quote>ke'axipa</quote>(IT-sub-1) means the same as plain 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>.</para>
    <para>Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter16" />), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo 
    <quote>zo'u</quote>, prefixed to the relative clause bridi:</para>

    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section10-example3" />is more verbose than 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section10-example2" />, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo 
    <quote>ko'a</quote>and
