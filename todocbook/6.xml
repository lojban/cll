    <para>If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that fills the places of simple Lojban sentences like:</para>

    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section1-example1" />, 
    <quote>mi</quote>and 
    <quote>le zarci</quote>are the sumti. It is easy to see that these two sumti are not of the same kind: 
    <quote>mi</quote>is a pro-sumti (the Lojban analogue of a pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas 
    <quote>le zarci</quote>is a description which refers to something described as being a market.</para>
    <para>There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:</para>

    <para>Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions. Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7" />, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter18" />, and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19" />respectively, so this chapter only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section13" />through 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section15" />for these summaries.</para>

        <selmaho>LE</selmaho>

        <description>elidable terminator for LE, LA</description>
      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>The syntax of descriptions is fairly complex, and not all of it can be explained within the confines of this chapter: relative clauses, in particular, are discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8" />. However, most descriptions have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE or LA, and a selbri. (The difference between selma'o LE and selma'o LA is not important until 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section12" />.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla. Here is an elementary example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-rBuQ">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d1" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example1" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le zarci</jbo>
        <gloss>one-or-more-specific-things-each-of-which-I-describe-as being-a-market</gloss>
        <en>the market</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The long gloss for 
    <quote>le</quote>is of course far too long to use most of the time, and in fact 
<!-- ^^   too long: example, 233; Example, 230 -->
<indexterm><primary>too long</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>le</quote>is quite close in meaning to English 
    <quote>the</quote>. It has particular implications, however, which 
    <quote>the</quote>does not have.</para>
    <para>The general purpose of all descriptors is to create a sumti which might occur in the x1 place of the selbri belonging to the description. Thus 
    <quote>le zarci</quote>conveys something which might be found in the x1 place of 
    <quote>zarci</quote>, namely a market.</para>
    <para>The specific purpose of 
    <quote>le</quote>is twofold. First, it indicates that the speaker has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are). Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing the things he or she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description.</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-ULGC">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d2" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example2" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le zarci cu barda</jbo>
        <gloss>One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as 
        <quote>markets</quote>is/are-big.</gloss>
        <gloss>The market is big.</gloss>
        <en>The markets are big.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to markets is to just one ( 
    <quote>the market</quote>) or to more than one ( 
    <quote>the markets</quote>). Lojban requires no such forced choice, so both colloquial translations of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example2" />are valid. Only the context can specify which is meant. (This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7" />.)</para>
    <para>Now consider the following strange-looking example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-PutX">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d3" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example3" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le nanmu cu ninmu</jbo>
        <gloss>One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as 
        <quote>men</quote>are women.</gloss>
        <gloss>The man is a woman.</gloss>
        <en>The men are women.</en>
<!-- ^^   The men are women: example, 120 -->
<indexterm><primary>The men are women</primary></indexterm>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example3" />is not self-contradictory in Lojban, because 
    <quote>le nanmu</quote>merely means something or other which, for my present purposes, I choose to describe as a man, whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would be: someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out to be actually a woman on closer observation. 
<!-- ^^   observation: example, 316 -->
<indexterm><primary>observation</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example3" />is what I would say to point out my observation to you.</para>
<!-- ^^   observation: example, 316 -->
<indexterm><primary>observation</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In all descriptions with 
    <quote>le</quote>, the listener is presumed to either know what I have in mind or else not to be concerned at present (perhaps I will give more identifying details later). In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or men: 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example3" />would then be perfectly intelligible, since 
    <quote>le nanmu</quote>merely clarifies that I am pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape, or a nose, which happens to lie in the same direction.</para>
    <para>The second descriptor dealt with in this section is 
    <quote>lo</quote>. Unlike 
    <quote>le</quote>, 
    <quote>lo</quote>is nonspecific:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-t11z">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d4" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example4" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>lo zarci</jbo>
        <gloss>one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really are-markets</gloss>
        <gloss>a market</gloss>
        <en>some markets</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Again, there are two colloquial English translations. The effect of using 
    <quote>lo</quote>in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example4" />is to refer generally to one or more markets, without being specific about which. Unlike 
    <quote>le zarci</quote>, 
    <quote>lo zarci</quote>must refer to something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is 
    <quote>zarci</quote>). Thus</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-fSxN">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d5" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example5" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>lo nanmu cu ninmu</jbo>
        <gloss>Some man is a woman.</gloss>
        <en>Some men are women.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>must be false in Lojban, given that there are no objects in the real world which are both men and women. Pointing at some specific men or women would not make 
<!-- ^^   real world: contrasted with hypothetical world, example, 320 -->
<indexterm><primary>real world</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example5" />true, because those specific individuals are no more both-men-and-women than any others. In general, 
    <quote>lo</quote>refers to whatever individuals meet its description.</para>
    <para>The last descriptor of this section is 
    <quote>la</quote>, which indicates that the selbri which follows it has been dissociated from its normal meaning and is being used as a name. Like 
    <quote>le</quote>descriptions, 
    <quote>la</quote>descriptions are implicitly restricted to those I have in mind. (Do not confuse this use of 
    <quote>la</quote>with its use before regular Lojbanized names, which is discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section12" />.) For example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-PrGp">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d6" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example6" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>la cribe pu finti le lisri</jbo>
        <gloss>The-one-named 
        <quote>bear</quote>[past] creates the story.</gloss>
        <en>Bear wrote the story.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example6" />, 
    <quote>la cribe</quote>refers to someone whose naming predicate is 
<!-- ^^   naming predicate, 121 -->
<indexterm><primary>naming predicate</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>cribe</quote>, i.e. 
    <quote>Bear</quote>. In English, most names don't mean anything, or at least not anything obvious. The name 
    <quote>Frank</quote>coincides with the English word 
    <quote>frank</quote>, meaning 
    <quote>honest</quote>, and so one way of translating 
    <quote>Frank ate some cheese</quote>into Lojban would be:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-yyBX">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d7" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example7" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>la stace pu citka lo cirla</jbo>
        <en>The-one-called 
        <quote>Honest/Frank</quote>[past] eats some cheese.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to be more attached to the sound of our names than their meaning, even if the meaning (etymological or current) is known. Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of fact, 
    <quote>Frank</quote>originally meant 
    <quote>the free one</quote>rather than 
    <quote>the honest one</quote>.)</para>
    <para>It is important to note the differences between 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example6" />and the following:</para>

    </example>

        <anchor xml:id="c6e2d9" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter6-section2-example9" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>lo cribe pu finti le lisri</jbo>
        <gloss>One-or-more-of-the-things-which-really are-bears [past] creates the story.</gloss>
        <gloss>A bear wrote the story.</gloss>
        <en>Some bears wrote the story.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example8" />is about a specific bear or bearlike thing(s), or thing(s) which the speaker (perhaps whimsically or metaphorically) describes as a bear (or more than one); 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example9" />is about one or more of the really existing, objectively defined bears. In either case, though, each of them must have contributed to the writing of the story, if more than one bear (or 
    <quote>bear</quote>) is meant.</para>
    <para>(The notion of a 
    <quote>really existing, objectively defined bear</quote>raises certain difficulties. Is a panda bear a 
    <quote>real bear</quote>? How about a teddy bear? In general, the answer is 
    <quote>yes</quote>. Lojban gismu are defined as broadly as possible, allowing tanru and lujvo to narrow down the definition. There probably are no necessary and sufficient conditions for defining what is and what is not a bear that can be pinned down with complete precision: the real world is fuzzy. In borderline cases, 
<!-- ^^   real world: contrasted with hypothetical world, example, 320 -->
<indexterm><primary>real world</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>le</quote>may communicate better than 
    <quote>lo</quote>.)</para>
    <para>So while 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example6" />could easily be true (there is a real writer named 
    <quote>Greg Bear</quote>), and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example8" />could be true if the speaker is sufficiently peculiar in what he or she describes as a bear, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example9" />is certainly false.</para>
    <para>Similarly, compare the following two examples, which are analogous to 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example8" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example9" />respectively:</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example10" />identifies the author as someone who can be pointed out or who has been previously mentioned; whereas if the topic is a person, then 
    <quote>le remna</quote>is in effect a shorthand reference to that person. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2-example11" />merely says that the author is human.</para>
    <para>The elidable terminator for all descriptions is 
    <quote>ku</quote>. It can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are in certain uses of relative clauses, which are discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8" />, and in the case of a description immediately preceding the selbri. In this latter case, using an explicit 
    <quote>cu</quote>before the selbri makes the 
    <quote>ku</quote>unnecessary. There are also a few other uses of 
    <quote>ku</quote>: in the compound negator 
    <quote>naku</quote>(discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15" />) and to terminate place-structure, tense, and modal tags that do not have associated sumti (discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter9" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10" />).</para>

    <para>All Lojban sumti are classified by whether they refer to one of three types of objects, known as 
    <quote>individuals</quote>, 
    <quote>masses</quote>, and 
    <quote>sets</quote>. The term 
    <quote>individual</quote>is misleading when used to refer to more than one object, but no less-confusing term has as yet been found. All the descriptions in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section1" />and

    <para>Suppose the context of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section3-example1" />is such that you can determine that I am talking about three persons. What am I claiming? I am claiming that each of the three persons carried the piano. This claim can be true if the persons carried the piano one at a time, or in turns, or in a variety of other ways. But in order for 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section3-example1" />to be true, I must be willing to assert that person 1 carried the piano, and that person 2 carried the piano, and that person 3 carried the piano.</para>
    <para>But suppose I am not willing to claim that. For in fact pianos are heavy, and very few persons can carry a piano all by themselves. The most likely factual situation is that person 1 carried one end of the piano, and person 2 the other end, while person 3 either held up the middle or else supervised the whole operation without actually lifting anything. The correct way of expressing such a situation in Lojban is:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Here the same three persons are treated not as individuals, but as a so-called 
    <quote>mass entity</quote>, or just 
    <quote>mass</quote>. A mass has the properties of each individual which composes it, and may have other properties of its own as well. This can lead to apparent contradictions. Thus suppose in the piano-moving example above that person 1 has fair skin, whereas person 2 has dark skin. Then it is correct to say that the person-mass has both fair skin and dark skin. Using the mass descriptor 
<!-- ^^   piano-moving: example, 123 -->
<indexterm><primary>piano-moving</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>lei</quote>signals that ordinary logical reasoning is not applicable: contradictions can be maintained, and all sorts of other peculiarities may exist. However, we can safely say that a mass inherits only the component properties that are relevant to it; it would be ludicrous to say that a mass of two persons is of molecular dimensions, simply because some of the parts (namely, the molecules) of the persons are that small.</para>

    <para>Of course, some butter is hard (for example, if it is frozen butter), so the

    <quote>butter</quote>, which are seen as already describing masses, are translated in Lojban by non-mass forms. The place structure of 
    <quote>matne</quote>is 
<!-- ^^   matne, 124 -->
<indexterm><primary>matne</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>x1 is a quantity of butter from source x2</quote>, so the single English word 
    <quote>butter</quote>is translated as something like 
    <quote>a part of the mass formed from all the quantities of butter that exist</quote>. (Note that the operation of forming a mass entity does not imply, in Lojban, that the components of the mass are necessarily close to one another or even related in any way other than conceptually.

    <para>Having said so much about masses, let us turn to sets. Sets are easier to understand than masses, but are more rarely used. Like a mass, a set is an abstract object formed from a number of individuals; however, the properties of a set are not derived from any of the properties of the individuals that compose it.</para>
    <para>Sets have properties like cardinality (how many elements in the set), membership (the relationship between a set and its elements), and set inclusion (the relationship between two sets, one of which - the superset – contains all the elements of the other - the subset). The set descriptors

    <para>Why is it necessary for the x3 place of

<indexterm><primary>mathematical expressions</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter18" />. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers 
    <quote>pa</quote>, 
    <quote>re</quote>, 
    <quote>ci</quote>, 
    <quote>vo</quote>, and 
    <quote>mu</quote>, meaning 
    <quote>one</quote>, 
    <quote>two</quote>, 
    <quote>three</quote>, 
    <quote>four</quote>, 
    <quote>five</quote>respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it - which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, 
    <quote>piro</quote>and 
    <quote>pisu'o</quote>, are explained in

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7" />.)</para>
    <para>Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The difference between 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example1" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example2" />is the presence of the explicit quantifier 
    <quote>re</quote>in the latter example. Although 
    <quote>re</quote>by itself means 
    <quote>two</quote>, when used as a quantifier it means 
    <quote>two-of</quote>. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be 
    <quote>walkers on the ice</quote>. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say 
    <quote>I own three shoes</quote>if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.</para>
    <para>(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence</para>

    <para>Now consider 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example1" />again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example1" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example4" />:</para>

    </example>
    <para>turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as 
<!-- ^^   personal pro-sumti, 139; implicit cancellation of by change of speaker/listener, 162; implicit quantifier for, 128, 139; stability of, 162 -->
<indexterm><primary>personal pro-sumti</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>mi</quote>and

<indexterm><primary>personal pro-sumti</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>implicit quantifier</quote>of

    <para>Not all sumti have 
    <quote>ro</quote>as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:</para>

    </example>
    <para>What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation 
    <quote>lu do cadzu le bisli li'u</quote>? Surely not

    <para>the meaning would be something like 
    <quote>I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'</quote>. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example5" />means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.</para>
    <para>The Lojban cmavo meaning 
    <quote>at least</quote>is

    <title>7. Quantified descriptions</title>
    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>Like other sumti, descriptions can be quantified. When a quantifier appears before a description, it has the same meaning as one appearing before a non-description sumti: it specifies how many things, of all those referred to by the description, are being talked about in this particular bridi. Suppose that context tells us that 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>refers to three dogs. Then we can say that exactly two of them are white as follows:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-WtUh">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c6e7d1" />

        <gloss>Two-of the dogs are-white.</gloss>
        <en>Two of the dogs are white.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>When discussing descriptions, this ordinary quantifier is called an 
    <quote>outer quantifier</quote>, since it appears outside the description. But there is another possible location for a quantifier: between the descriptor and the selbri. This quantifier is called an 
    <quote>inner quantifier</quote>, and its meaning is quite different: it tells the listener how many objects the description selbri characterizes.</para>
    <para>For example, the context of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7-example1" />supposedly told us that 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>referred to some three specific dogs. This assumption can be made certain with the use of an explicit inner quantifier:</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section6-example3" />, simple numbers like those in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7-example2" />must be exact: it therefore follows that the third dog cannot be white.)</para>
    <para>You may also specify an explicit inner quantifier and leave the outer quantifier implicit:</para>

    </example>
    <para>There are rules for each of the 11 descriptors specifying what the implicit values for the inner and outer quantifiers are.

    <para>When examined for the first time, this table looks dreadfully arbitrary. In fact, there are quite a few regularities in it. First of all, the la-series (that is, the descriptors 
    <quote>la</quote>, 
    <quote>lai</quote>, and 
    <quote>la'i</quote>) and the le-series (that is, the descriptors 
    <quote>le</quote>, 
    <quote>lei</quote>, 
    <quote>le'i</quote>, and 
    <quote>le'e</quote>) always have corresponding implicit quantifiers, so we may subsume the la-series under the le-series for the rest of this discussion: 
    <quote>le-series cmavo</quote>will refer to both the le-series proper and to the la-series.</para>
<!-- ^^   le-series cmavo: as encompassing le-series and la-series descriptors for quantification discussion, 130; definition, 130; rationale for implicit inner quantifier, 130; rule for implicit inner quantifier, 130 -->
<indexterm><primary>le-series cmavo</primary></indexterm>
    <para>The rule for the inner quantifier is very simple: the lo-series cmavo (namely, 
<!-- ^^   lo-series cmavo: rationale for implicit inner quantifier, 130; rule for implicit inner quantifier, 130 -->
<indexterm><primary>lo-series cmavo</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>lo</quote>, 
    <quote>loi</quote>, 
    <quote>lo'i</quote>, and 
    <quote>lo'e</quote>) all have an implicit inner quantifier of 
    <quote>ro</quote>, whereas the le-series cmavo all have an implicit inner quantifier of 
<!-- ^^   le-series cmavo: as encompassing le-series and la-series descriptors for quantification discussion, 130; definition, 130; rationale for implicit inner quantifier, 130; rule for implicit inner quantifier, 130 -->
<indexterm><primary>le-series cmavo</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>su'o</quote>.</para>
    <para>Why? Because lo-series descriptors always refer to all of the things which really fit into the x1 place of the selbri. They are not restricted by the speaker's intention. Descriptors of the le-series, however, are so restricted, and therefore talk about some number, definite or indefinite, of objects the speaker has in mind - but never less than one.</para>
    <para>Understanding the implicit outer quantifier requires rules of greater subtlety. In the case of mass and set descriptors, a single rule suffices for each: reference to a mass is implicitly a reference to some part of the mass; reference to a set is implicitly a reference to the whole set. Masses and sets are inherently singular objects: it makes no sense to talk about two distinct masses with the same components, or two distinct sets with the same members. Therefore, the largest possible outer quantifier for either a set description or a mass description is 
    <quote>piro</quote>, the whole of it.</para>
    <para>(Pedantically, it is possible that the mass of water molecules composing an ice cube might be thought of as different from the same mass of water molecules in liquid form, in which case we might talk about 
    <quote>re lei djacu</quote>, two masses of the water-bits I have in mind.)</para>
    <para>Why 
    <quote>pi-</quote>? It is the Lojban cmavo for the decimal point. Just as 
<!-- ^^   decimal point: as numerical punctuation, 433; effect of different notations, 433; in bases other than 10, 444 -->
<indexterm><primary>decimal point</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>pimu</quote>means 
    <quote>.5</quote>, and when used as a quantifier specifies a portion consisting of five tenths of a thing, 
    <quote>piro</quote>means a portion consisting of the all-ness – the entirety - of a thing. Similarly, 
    <quote>pisu'o</quote>specifies a portion consisting of at least one part of a thing, i.e. some of it.</para>
<!-- ^^   pisu'o: explanation of meaning, 130 -->
<indexterm><primary>pisu'o</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Smaller quantifiers are possible for sets, and refer to subsets. Thus 
<!-- ^^   subsets: expressing with outer quantifiers, 131 -->
<indexterm><primary>subsets</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>pimu le'i nanmu</quote>is a subset of the set of men I have in mind; we don't know precisely which elements make up this subset, but it must have half the size of the full set. This is the best way to say 
    <quote>half of the men</quote>; saying 
    <quote>pimu le nanmu</quote>would give us a half-portion of one of them instead! Of course, the result of 
    <quote>pimu le'i nanmu</quote>is still a set; if you need to refer to the individuals of the subset, you must say so (see 
    <quote>lu'a</quote>in 
<!-- ^^   lu'a, 134; effect of on meaning, 134 -->
<indexterm><primary>lu'a</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section10" />).</para>
    <para>The case of outer quantifiers for individual descriptors (including 
    <quote>le</quote>, 
    <quote>lo</quote>, 
    <quote>la</quote>, and the typical descriptors 
    <quote>le'e</quote>and 
    <quote>lo'e</quote>) is special. When we refer to specific individuals with 
    <quote>le</quote>, we mean to refer to all of those we have in mind, so 
    <quote>ro</quote>is appropriate as the implicit quantifier, just as it is appropriate for 
    <quote>do</quote>. Reference to non-specific individuals with 
    <quote>lo</quote>, however, is typically to only some of the objects which can be correctly described, and so 
    <quote>su'o</quote>is the appropriate implicit quantifier, just as for quotations.</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7-example4" />is part of the specification: it tells us the actual number of dogs in the group that the speaker has in mind. In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section7-example5" />, however, the dogs referred to by 
    <quote>... lo gerku</quote>are all the dogs that exist: the outer quantifier then restricts the number to three; which three, we cannot tell. The implicit quantifiers are chosen to avoid claiming too much or too little: in the case of 
    <quote>le</quote>, the implicit outer quantifier 
    <quote>ro</quote>says that each of the dogs in the restricted group is white; in the case of 
    <quote>lo</quote>, the implicit inner quantifier simply says that three dogs, chosen from the group of all the dogs there are, are white.</para>
    <para>Using exact numbers as inner quantifiers in lo-series descriptions is dangerous, because you are stating that exactly that many things exist which really fit the description. So examples like</para>

    <para>As stated in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2" />, most descriptions consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter, the selbri have always been single gismu, but of course any selbri, however complex, can be employed in a description. The syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter5" />.) In the intervening sections, inner and outer quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now it is time to discuss a description of a radically different kind: the sumti-based description.</para>

    <para>The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed, or to indicate to that person that he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in more detail in

    <quote>doi</quote>, or else just 
    <quote>doi</quote>by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee. The most common case is a name:</para>

    <title>12. Lojban names</title>
    <para>Names have been used freely as sumti throughout this chapter without too much explanation. The time for the explanation has now come.</para>
    <para>First of all, there are two different kinds of things usually called 
    <quote>names</quote>when talking about Lojban. The naming predicates of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6-section2" />are just ordinary predicates which are being used in a special sense. In addition, though, there is a class of Lojban words which are used only to name things: these can be recognized by the fact that they end in a consonant followed by a pause. Some examples:</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4" />for more information.)</para>
    <para>Names of this kind have two basic uses in Lojban: when used in a vocative phrase (see
