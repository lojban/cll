  <title>Chapter 19 Putting It All Together: Notes on the Structure of Lojban Texts</title>
  <section xml:id="cll_chapter19-section1">
    <title>1. Introductory</title>
    <para>This chapter is incurably miscellaneous. It describes the cmavo that specify the structure of Lojban texts, from the largest scale (paragraphs) to the smallest (single words). There are fewer examples than are found in other chapters of this book, since the linguistic mechanisms described are generally made use of in conversation or else in long documents.</para>
    <para>This chapter is also not very self-contained. It makes passing reference to a great many concepts which are explained in full only in other chapters. The alternative would be a chapter on text structure which was as complex as all the other chapters put together. Lojban is a unified language, and it is not possible to understand any part of it (in full) before understanding every part of it (to some degree).</para>

    <title>2. Sentences: I</title>
    <para>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</para>

    <para>Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and the start of the following one. In written English, a period serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour (rising or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause. Lojban uses a single separator: the cmavo 
<!-- ^^   audio-visually isomorphic, 465 -->

    </example>
    <para>The word 
    <quote>separator</quote>should be noted. 
    <quote>.i</quote>is not normally used after the last sentence nor before the first one, although both positions are technically grammatical. 
    <quote>.i</quote>signals a new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same speaker. The relationship between the sentences is left vague, except in stories, where the relationship usually is temporal, and the following sentence states something that happened after the previous sentence.</para>
<!-- ^^   stories: flow of time in, 236 -->
<indexterm><primary>stories</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Note that although the first letter of an English sentence is capitalized, the cmavo 
    <quote>.i</quote>is never capitalized. In writing, it is appropriate to place extra space before 
    <quote>.i</quote>to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of Lojban writing, every 
    <quote>.i</quote>is placed at the beginning of a line, possibly leaving space at the end of the previous line.</para>
    <para>An 
    <quote>.i</quote>cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of the following sentence is different from the speaker of the preceding sentence, depending on whether the sentences are felt to be connected or not.</para>
    <para>An 
    <quote>.i</quote>cmavo can be compounded with a logical or non-logical connective (a jek or joik), a modal or tense connective, or both: these constructs are explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter9" />, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10" />, and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14" />. In all cases, the 
    <quote>.i</quote>comes first in the compound. Attitudinals can also be attached to an 
    <quote>.i</quote>if they are meant to apply to the whole sentence: see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter13" />.</para>
    <para>There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of sentences closely together. If the 
    <quote>.i</quote>(with or without connectives) is followed by 
    <quote>bo</quote>(of selma'o BO), then the two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely grouped than sentences connected by 
    <quote>.i</quote>alone.</para>
    <para>Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>(of selma'o TUhE) and followed by 
    <quote>tu'u</quote>(of selma'o TUhU) to fuse them into a single unit. A common use of 
    <quote>tu'e ... tu'u</quote>is to group the sentences which compose a poem: the title sentence would precede the group, separated from it by 
    <quote>.i</quote>. Another use might be a set of directions, where each numbered direction might be surrounded by 
    <quote>tu'e ... tu'u</quote>and contain one or more sentences separated by 
    <quote>.i</quote>. Grouping with 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>and 
    <quote>tu'u</quote>is analogous to grouping with 
    <quote>ke</quote>and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote>to establish the scope of logical or non-logical connectives (see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14" />).</para>

    <title>3. Paragraphs: NIhO</title>
    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>

      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>The paragraph is a concept used in writing systems for two purposes: to indicate changes of topic, and to break up the hard-to-read appearance of large blocks of text on the page. The former function is represented in both spoken and written Lojban by the cmavo 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>and 
    <quote>no'i</quote>, both of selma'o NIhO. Of these two, 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>is the more common. By convention, written Lojban is broken into paragraphs just before any 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>or 
    <quote>no'i</quote>, but a very long passage on a single topic might be paragraphed before an 
    <quote>.i</quote>. On the other hand, it is conventional in English to start a new paragraph in dialogue when a new speaker starts, but this convention is not commonly observed in Lojban dialogues. Of course, none of these conventions affect meaning in any way.</para>
    <para>A 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>can take the place of an 
    <quote>.i</quote>as a sentence separator, and in addition signals a new topic or paragraph. Grammatically, any number of 
<!-- ^^   sentence separator, 495 -->
<indexterm><primary>sentence separator</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ni'o</quote>cmavo can appear consecutively and are equivalent to a single one; semantically, a greater number of 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>cmavo indicates a larger-scale change of topic. This feature allows complexly structured text, with topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics, to be represented clearly and unambiguously in both spoken and written Lojban. However, some conventional differences do exist between 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>in writing and in conversation.</para>
    <para>In written text, a single 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>is a mere discursive indicator of a new subject, whereas 
<!-- ^^   discursive indicator, 466 -->
<indexterm><primary>discursive indicator</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ni'oni'o</quote>marks a change in the context. In this situation, 
    <quote>ni'oni'o</quote>implicitly cancels the definitions of all pro-sumti of selma'o KOhA as well as pro-bridi of selma'o GOhA. (Explicit cancelling is expressed by the cmavo 
    <quote>da'o</quote>of selma'o DAhO, which has the free grammar of an indicator – it can appear almost anywhere.) The use of 
<!-- ^^   da'o, 162, 466; for cancellation of pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignment, 162; syntax of, 162 -->
<indexterm><primary>da'o</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ni'oni'o</quote>does not affect indicators (of selma'o UI) or tense references, but 
    <quote>ni'oni'oni'o</quote>, indicating a drastic change of topic, would serve to reset both indicators and tenses. (See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19-section8" />for a discussion of indicator scope.)</para>
<!-- ^^   indicator scope, 466 -->
<indexterm><primary>indicator scope</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In spoken text, which is inherently less structured, these levels are reduced by one, with 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>indicating a change in context sufficient to cancel pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignment. On the other hand, in a book, or in stories within stories such as 
<!-- ^^   stories: flow of time in, 236 -->
<indexterm><primary>stories</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>The Arabian Nights</quote>, further levels may be expressed by extending the 
<!-- ^^   Arabian Nights: as multi-level narrative, 467 -->
<indexterm><primary>Arabian Nights</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ni'o</quote>string as needed. Normally, a written text will begin with the number of 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>cmavo needed to signal the largest scale division which the text contains. 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>strings may be subscripted to label each context of discourse: see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19-section6" />.</para>
    <para>
    <quote>no'i</quote>is similar in effect to 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>, but indicates the resumption of a previous topic. In speech, it is analogous to (but much shorter than) such English discursive phrases as 
<!-- ^^   previous topic, 467 -->
<indexterm><primary>previous topic</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>But getting back to the point ...</quote>. By default, the topic resumed is that in effect before the last 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>. When subtopics are nested within topics, then 
    <quote>no'i</quote>would resume the previous subtopic and 
<!-- ^^   resume: contrasted with begin, 229 -->
<indexterm><primary>resume</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>no'ino'i</quote>the previous topic. Note that 
<!-- ^^   previous topic, 467 -->
<indexterm><primary>previous topic</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>no'i</quote>also resumes tense and pro-sumti assignments dropped at the previous 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>.</para>
    <para>If a 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>is subscripted, then a 
    <quote>no'i</quote>with the same subscript is assumed to be a continuation of it. A 
    <quote>no'i</quote>may also have a negative subscript, which would specify counting backwards a number of paragraphs and resuming the topic found thereby.</para>

    <para>In Chinese, the normal sentence form is different: a topic is stated, and a comment about it is made.

    <para>The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as well, but in Lojban the sumti in the x1 place is not necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don't necessarily have a

    <para>Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form 
    <quote>Is it true that ...</quote>, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo 
    <quote>xu</quote>(of selma'o UI):</para>

    <para>(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in

    <para>Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.</para>
    <para>Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with

    <para>(Note: A mechanical substitution of

    <quote>ku</quote>, for reasons explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14" />. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)</para>

    <para>Lojban provides two groups of pro-sumti, both belonging to selma'o KOhA. The ko'a-series cmavo are used to refer to explicitly specified sumti to which they have been bound using 
    <quote>goi</quote>. The da-series, on the other hand, are existentially or universally quantified variables. (These concepts are explained more fully in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter16" />.) There are ten ko'a-series cmavo and 3 da-series cmavo available.</para>
    <para>If more are required, any cmavo of the ko'a-series or the da-series can be subscripted:</para>

    </example>
    <para>is the 18th free variable of the 3rd sequence of the ko'a-series. This convention allows 10 sequences of ko'a-type pro-sumti and 3 sequences of da-type pro-sumti, each with as many members as needed. Note that 
    <quote>daxivo</quote>and 
    <quote>dexivo</quote>are considered to be distinct pro-sumti, unlike the situation with 
    <quote>sexixa</quote>and 
    <quote>vexixa</quote>above. Exactly similar treatment can be given to the bu'a-series of selma'o GOhA and to the gismu pro-bridi 
    <quote>broda</quote>, 
    <quote>brode</quote>, 
    <quote>brodi</quote>, 
    <quote>brodo</quote>, and 
    <quote>brodu</quote>.</para>
    <para>Subscripts on lerfu words are used in the standard mathematical way to extend the number of variables:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-wez6">
      <title>

<indexterm><primary>x-sub-3</primary></indexterm>
        <en>x</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>and can be used to extend the number of pro-sumti as well, since lerfu strings outside mathematical contexts are grammatically and semantically equivalent to pro-sumti of the ko'a-series. (In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19-section6-example9" />, note the required terminator 
    <quote>boi</quote>after each 
    <quote>xy.</quote>cmavo; this terminator allows the subscript to be attached without ambiguity.)</para>
    <para>Names, which are similar to pro-sumti, can also be subscripted to distinguish two individuals with the same name:</para>

        <en>John</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Subscripts on tenses allow talking about more than one time or place that is described by the same general cmavo. For example, 
    <quote>puxipa</quote>could refer to one point in the past, and 
    <quote>puxire</quote>a second point (earlier or later).</para>
    <para>You can place a subscript on the word 
    <quote>ja'a</quote>, the bridi affirmative of selma'o NA, to express so-called fuzzy truths. The usual machinery for fuzzy logic (statements whose truth value is not merely 
    <quote>true</quote>or 
    <quote>false</quote>, but is expressed by a number in the range 0 to 1) in Lojban is the abstractor 
    <quote>jei</quote>:</para>

    </example>
    <para>However, by convention we can attach a subscript to 
    <quote>ja'a</quote>to indicate fuzzy truth (or to

    <para>Finally, as mentioned in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19-section2" />, 
    <quote>ni'o</quote>and 
    <quote>no'i</quote>cmavo with matching subscripts mark the start and the continuation of a given topic respectively. Different topics can be assigned to different subscripts.</para>

    <para>But in fact there are four different flavors of quotation in the language, involving six cmavo of six different selma'o. This being the case, quotation deserves some elaboration.</para>
    <para>The simplest kind of quotation, exhibited in

    <quote>li'u</quote>(of selma'o LIhU) as the closing quotation mark. The text between

    <quote>li'u</quote>must be a valid, parseable Lojban text. If the quotation is ungrammatical, so is the surrounding expression. The cmavo 
    <quote>li'u</quote>is technically an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to elide it except at the end of text.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>lo'u</quote>(of selma'o LOhU) and 
    <quote>le'u</quote>(of selma'o LEhU) are used to surround a quotation that is not necessarily grammatical Lojban. However, the text must consist of morphologically correct Lojban words (as defined in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4" />), so that the 
    <quote>le'u</quote>can be picked out reliably. The words need not be meaningful, but they must be recognizable as cmavo, brivla, or cmene. Quotation with 
    <quote>lo'u</quote>is essential to quoting ungrammatical Lojban for teaching in the language, the equivalent of the * that is used in English to mark such errors:</para>

    <quote>toi</quote>are discursive (non-mathematical) parentheses, for inserting parenthetical remarks. Any text whatsoever can go within the parentheses, and it is completely invisible to its context. It can, however, refer to the context by the use of pro-sumti and pro-bridi: any that have been assigned in the context are still assigned in the parenthetical remarks, but the reverse is not true.</para>

<indexterm><primary>embedded discursive</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>sei</quote>are called

    <para>This restriction allows the terminator cmavo 
    <quote>se'u</quote>to almost always be elided.</para>
    <para>Since a discursive utterance is working at a 
    <quote>higher</quote>level of abstraction than a non-discursive utterance, a non-discursive utterance cannot refer to a discursive utterance. Specifically, the various back-counting, reciprocal, and reflexive constructs in selma'o KOhA ignore the utterances at 
<!-- ^^   reciprocal: expression of mathematical, 433 -->
<indexterm><primary>reciprocal</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>higher</quote>metalinguistic levels in determining their referent. It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to refer to lower metalinguistic levels. For example, the English 
<!-- ^^   metalinguistic levels, 481 -->
<indexterm><primary>metalinguistic levels</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>he said</quote>in a conversation is metalinguistic. For this purpose, quotations are considered to be at a lower metalinguistic level than the surrounding context (a quoted text cannot refer to the statements of the one who quotes it), whereas parenthetical remarks are considered to be at a higher level than the context.</para>
    <para>Lojban works differently from English in that the 
    <quote>he said</quote>can be marked instead of the quotation. In Lojban, you can say:</para>

    <quote>sa</quote>right is even more difficult (for a computer) than getting

    <quote>sa</quote>is generally easier for human beings, because the rules for using it correctly are less finicky.</para>
    <para>The cmavo

    <para>Speakers often need to hesitate to think of what to say next or for some extra-linguistic reason. There are two ways to hesitate in Lojban: to pause between words (that is, to say nothing) or to use the cmavo 
    <quote>.y.</quote>(of selma'o Y). This resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written 
<!-- ^^   hesitation, 484, 507 -->
<indexterm><primary>hesitation</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>uh</quote>(or 
    <quote>er</quote>), but differs from it in the requirement for pauses before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be mistaken for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the speaker. Since vowel length is not significant in Lojban, the 
    <quote>y</quote>sound can be dragged out for as long as necessary. Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required pauses are respected.</para>
    <para>Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal language, English-speakers may question the need for a formal cmavo. Speakers of other languages, however, often hesitate by saying (or, if necessary, repeating) a word (
