    <quote>LOZH-bahn</quote>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called 
    <quote>Loglan</quote> by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article 
    
    
    <quote><citetitle pubwork="article">Loglan</citetitle></quote>, published in 
    <citetitle pubwork="journal">Scientific American</citetitle>, June, 1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel 
    
    <citetitle pubwork="book">The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</citetitle>) and computer publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).</para>

The following are the main features of Lojban:</para>

    <title>What is this book?</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>goal of this book</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>goal of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>reference grammar</primary></indexterm> This book is what is called a 
    <quote>reference grammar</quote>. It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present. Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features. The word 
    
    <quote>discover</quote> is used advisedly; Lojban was not 
    <quote>invented</quote> by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.</para>
    <para>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tour"/> gives a brief overview of the language, 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/> gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic flesh on those formal bones. I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become available.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>linguistic drift</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>Lojban</primary><secondary>stability of</secondary></indexterm> Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary &ndash; Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world, as 
    <xref linkend="chapter-lujvo"/> explains &ndash; and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?) native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language-meisters.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>structure of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>structure of this book</primary></indexterm> It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas. Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>chapter titles</primary><secondary>intent of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>jokes</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>Lojbanistan</primary></indexterm> Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of 
    <xref linkend="chapter-about"/> (which you are now reading), for example, is an allusion to the book 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">English As We Speak It In Ireland</citetitle>, by P. W. Joyce, which is a sort of informal reference grammar of Hiberno-English. 
    
    <quote>Lojbanistan</quote> is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language, and a term for the actual community of Lojban-speakers, scattered over the world. Why 
    
    <quote>mangle</quote>? As yet, nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all well, by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan; that is one of the circumstances this book is meant to help remedy.</para>

  <section xml:id="section-conventions">
    <title>What are the typographical conventions of this book?</title>
    
    <para>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>this book</primary><secondary>examples of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>examples in this book</primary></indexterm> The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-hrtj">
      <title>
        

<indexterm type="example"><primary>go to the store</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>


        <anchor xml:id="c1e3d1"/>
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>mi klama le zarci</jbo>
        <gloss>I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.</gloss>
        <natlang>I go to the store.</natlang>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>  will become wearisomely familiar before 
    <xref linkend="chapter-grammars"/> is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>examples</primary><secondary>structure of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>structure of examples</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>example of examples</primary></indexterm> It is useful to talk further about 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-hrtj"/> for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the 
    
    <quote>literal translation</quote> and the 
    <quote>colloquial translation</quote> respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>square brackets</primary><secondary>use of in notation</secondary></indexterm> Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-phonology"/>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>grammatical categories</primary><secondary>use of upper case for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>tables</primary><secondary>format of</secondary></indexterm> Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>technical terms</primary></indexterm> A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in 
    
    <xref linkend="chapter-tour"/>, except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters.</para>

    <title>Disclaimers</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>disclaimers</primary></indexterm> It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>dictionary</primary><secondary>superior authority of</secondary></indexterm> When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published). If so, the information given in the dictionary supersedes whatever is given here.</para>

    <title>Informal Bibliography</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>Loglan</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>bibliography</primary></indexterm> The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is one of the products, is 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">Loglan 1: A Logical Language</citetitle> by James Cooke Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.). The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him.</para>
    
    <para>The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American philosopher W. v.O. Quine, especially 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">Word and Object</citetitle> (1960, M.I.T. Press). Much of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on observation sentences, reads like a literal translation from Lojban.</para>
    
    <para>The theory of negation expounded in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-negation"/> is derived from a reading of Laurence Horn's work 
    <citetitle pubwork="book">A Natural History of Negation</citetitle>.</para>
    <para>Of course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the uses or misuses I have made of their works.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>books about Lojban</primary></indexterm> Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three other books about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English dictionary, and a book containing general information about Lojban. You can probably get these books, if they have been published, from the same place where you got this book. In addition, other books not yet foreseen may also exist.</para>
