    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>truth functions</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>logical language</primary><secondary>truth functions</secondary></indexterm> Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means 
    
    <quote>logical language</quote>. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a 
    
    <quote>sentence</quote> (sometimes called a 
    <quote>statement</quote> or 
    <quote>proposition</quote>), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of 
    <quote>truth functions</quote>, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,</para>

      <title>

      </title>
      <para>John is a man or James is a woman.</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>man or woman</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm> is true if 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true, or if 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether 
    <quote>John is a man or James is a woman</quote> is true, provided we know the meaning of 
    <quote>or</quote>. Here 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> and 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> are the component sentences.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>negating a sentence</primary><secondary>and truth value</secondary></indexterm> We will use the phrase 
    <quote>negating a sentence</quote> to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing 
    
    <quote>It is false that ...</quote>, or more idiomatically by inserting 
    <quote>not</quote> at the right point, generally before the verb. 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote> is the negation of 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation 
    <quote>Not!</quote></para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>logical connectives</primary></indexterm> Words like 
    <quote>or</quote> are called 
    <quote>logical connectives</quote>, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as 
    
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>and/or</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>only if</quote>, 
    <quote>whether or not</quote>, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</para>
    <para>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>truth table</primary><secondary>explanation</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>truth functions</primary><secondary>16 possible</secondary></indexterm> There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for 
    
    <quote>or</quote>:</para>

    <para>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of the result is also false.</para>
    <para>Suppose that 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true (and 
    <quote>John is not a man</quote> is false), and that

Let the letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by reading down the third column of the table above. So TTTF is the abbreviated truth table for the 
    
    
    <quote>or</quote> truth function. Here are the 16 possible truth functions, with an English version of what it means to assert that each function is, in fact, true ( 
    <quote>first</quote> refers to the first sentence, and 
    <quote>second</quote> to the second sentence):</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>rationale for multiple sets in grammar</secondary></indexterm> In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result.</para>

    <quote>saw the horses</quote>, a sentence with subject omitted, or by 
    <quote>John went to the door</quote>, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</para>

Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>logical connectives</primary><secondary>cmavo</secondary><tertiary>format for each selma'o</tertiary></indexterm> Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> is 
    <jbophrase>a</jbophrase>. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, which is a truth function, or 
    <jbophrase>a</jbophrase>, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> in selma'o GIhA is 
    <jbophrase>gi'e</jbophrase>, and the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> in selma'o GA is 
    <jbophrase>gu</jbophrase>. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>compound logical connectives</primary><secondary>components</secondary></indexterm> Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in 
    <xref linkend="section-introduction"/>. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo 
    <jbophrase>se</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>na</jbophrase>, or 
    <jbophrase>nai</jbophrase>. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</para>

The name is derived by changing the final 
    <quote>-A</quote> of the selma'o name to 
    <quote>-ek</quote>; the reasons for using 
    <quote>-ek</quote> are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use 
    <quote>eks</quote> as the plural of 
    
    <quote>ek</quote>.) When the term 
    <quote>logical connective</quote> is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.</para>

    <quote>six types</quote> when there are only five selma'o? A jek may be preceded by

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>logical connectives in tanru</primary></indexterm> As noted at the beginning of 
    <xref linkend="section-compound-bridi"/>, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru 
    <jbophrase>blanu zdani</jbophrase>, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of 
    <jbophrase>blanu bolci</jbophrase>, Lojbanists can say 
    <jbophrase>blanu je bolci</jbophrase>, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in 
    <xref linkend="section-termsets"/> also, but there they were always prefixed by 
    <jbophrase>pe'e</jbophrase>; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:</para>

    <para>So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions.

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>truth questions</primary><secondary>simple</secondary></indexterm> The simplest kind of question is of the type 
    <quote>Is it true that ...</quote> where some statement follows. This type is called a

    <quote>Is Fido a dog?</quote> is the truth question corresponding to 
    <quote>Fido is a dog</quote>. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo

    <quote>cross product</quote> (also known as

The union of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in either set; the intersection of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets is the set of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains a single element from the first set followed by a single element from the second.

    <para>fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that the buying came after the going. (It also fails to represent that the buying was a consequence of the going, which can be expressed by a modal that is discussed in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti-tcita"/>.) However, the tense information - that the event of my going to the market preceded the event of my buying food - can be added to the logical connective as follows. The 
    <jbophrase>.ije</jbophrase> is replaced by 
    <jbophrase>.ijebo</jbophrase>, and the tense cmavo 
    <jbophrase>ba</jbophrase> is inserted between

Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:</para>
