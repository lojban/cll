    <title>1. Logical connection and truth tables</title>
    <para>Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means 
    <quote>logical language</quote>. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a 
    <quote>sentence</quote>(sometimes called a 
    <quote>statement</quote>or 
    <quote>proposition</quote>), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of 
    <quote>truth functions</quote>, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,</para>

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>John is a man or James is a woman.</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>is true if 
    <quote>John is a man</quote>is true, or if 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether 
    <quote>John is a man or James is a woman</quote>is true, provided we know the meaning of 
    <quote>or</quote>. Here 
    <quote>John is a man</quote>and 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>are the component sentences.</para>
    <para>We will use the phrase 
    <quote>negating a sentence</quote>to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing 
    <quote>It is false that ...</quote>, or more idiomatically by inserting 
    <quote>not</quote>at the right point, generally before the verb. 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote>is the negation of 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation 
    <quote>Not!</quote></para>
    <para>Words like 
    <quote>or</quote>are called 
    <quote>logical connectives</quote>, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as 
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>and/or</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>only if</quote>, 
    <quote>whether or not</quote>, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</para>
    <para>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.</para>
    <para>There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for 
    <quote>or</quote>:</para>
    <informaltable>
      <tgroup cols="3">
        <colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" />
        <colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" />
        <colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" />

          <row>
            <entry>False</entry>
            <entry>False</entry>
            <entry>False</entry>

        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </informaltable>
    <para>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of the result is also false.</para>
    <para>Suppose that 
    <quote>John is a man</quote>is true (and 
    <quote>John is not a man</quote>is false), and that 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>is false (and 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote>is true). Then the truth table tells us that</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
       
<quote>John is a man, or James is not a woman</quote>             (true   true )  is true;
       
<quote>John is a man, or James is a woman</quote>                 (true , false)  is true;
       
<quote>John is not a man, or James is not a woman</quote>         (false, true )  is true;
       
<quote>John is not a man, or James is a woman</quote>             (false, false)  is false.
</programlisting>
    <para>Note that the kind of 
    <quote>or</quote>used in this example can also be expressed (in formal English) with 
    <quote>and/or</quote>. There is a different truth table for the kind of 
    <quote>or</quote>that means 
    <quote>either ... or ... but not both</quote>.</para>
    <para>To save space, we will write truth tables in a shorter format henceforth. Let the letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by reading down the third column of the table above. So TTTF is the abbreviated truth table for the 
    <quote>or</quote>truth function. Here are the 16 possible truth functions, with an English version of what it means to assert that each function is, in fact, true (
    <quote>first</quote>refers to the first sentence, and 
    <quote>second</quote>to the second sentence):</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    TTTT    (always true)
    TTTF    first is true and/or second is true.
    TTFT    first is true if second is true.
    TTFF    first is true whether or not second is true.
    TFTT    first is true only if second is true.
    TFTF    whether or not first is true, second is true.
    TFFT    first is true if and only if second is true.
    TFFF    first is true and second is true

    FTTT    first and second are not both true.
    FTTF    first or second is true, but not both.
    FTFT    whether or not first is true, second is false.
    FTFF    first is true, but second is false.
    FFTT    first is false whether or not second is true.
    FFTF    first is false, but second is true.
    FFFT    neither first nor second is true.
    FFFF    (always false)
</programlisting>
    <para>Skeptics may work out the detailed truth tables for themselves.</para>

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter14-section2">
    <title>2. The Four basic vowels</title>
    <para>Lojban regards four of these 16 truth functions as fundamental, and assigns them the four vowels 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>, and 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>. These letters do not represent actual cmavo or selma'o, but rather a component vowel from which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up, as explained in the next section. Here are the four vowels, their truth tables, and rough English equivalents:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>   TTTF    or, and/or
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>   TFFF    and
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>   TFFT    if and only if
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>   TTFF    whether or not
</programlisting>
    <para>More precisely:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>   is true if either or both sentences are true;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>   is true if both sentences are true, but not otherwise;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>   is true if the sentences are both true or both false;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>   is true if the first sentence is true, regardless of the truth value of the second sentence.
</programlisting>
    <para>With the four vowels, the ability to negate either sentence, and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been reversed, we can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF, which are fairly useless anyway. The following table illustrates how to create each of the 14 remaining truth functions:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    TTTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>
    TTFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with second sentence negated
    TTFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>
    TFTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with first sentence negated
    TFTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with sentences exchanged
    TFFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>
    TFFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>

    FTTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with both sentences negated
    FTTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase> with either first or second negated (not both)
    FTFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with sentences exchanged and then second negated
    FTFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with second sentence negated
    FFTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with first sentence negated
    FFTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with first sentence negated
    FFFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with both sentences negated
</programlisting>
    <para>Note that exchanging the sentences is only necessary with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>. The three other basic truth functions are commutative; that is, they mean the same thing regardless of the order of the component sentences. There are other ways of getting some of these truth tables; these just happen to be the methods usually employed.</para>

    <title>3. The six types of logical connectives</title>
    <para>In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>Consider the English sentence:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-ptgf">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e3d1" />
        <anchor xml:id="cll_chapter14-section3-example1" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>Mary went to the window and ...</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>where the last word could be followed by 
    <quote>the door</quote>, a noun phrase, or by 
    <quote>saw the horses</quote>, a sentence with subject omitted, or by 
    <quote>John went to the door</quote>, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</para>
    <para>Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</para>
    <para>Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>is 
    <quote>a</quote>. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, which is a truth function, or 
    <quote>a</quote>, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>in selma'o GIhA is 
    <quote>gi'e</quote>, and the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>in selma'o GA is 
    <quote>gu</quote>. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</para>
    <para>Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section1" />. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo 
    <quote>se</quote>, 
    <quote>na</quote>, or 
    <quote>nai</quote>. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para>For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used for logical connection is designated by a Lojban name. The name is derived by changing the final 
    <quote>-A</quote>of the selma'o name to 
    <quote>-ek</quote>; the reasons for using 
    <quote>-ek</quote>are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use 
    <quote>eks</quote>as the plural of 
    <quote>ek</quote>.) When the term 
    <quote>logical connective</quote>is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.</para>
    <para>Why does the title of this section refer to 
    <quote>six types</quote>when there are only five selma'o? A jek may be preceded by 
    <quote>.i</quote>, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences. The compound produced by 
    <quote>.i</quote>followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.</para>
    <para>There also exist giks, joiks, ijoiks, and joigiks, which are not logical connectives, but are other kinds of compound cmavo which will be introduced later.</para>

    <para>To obtain the other truth tables listed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section2" />, we need to know how to negate the two bridi which represent the component sentences. We could negate them directly by inserting 
    <quote>na</quote>before the selbri, but Lojban also allows us to place the negation within the connective itself.</para>
    <para>To negate the first or left-hand bridi, prefix 
    <quote>na</quote>to the JA cmavo but after the 
    <quote>.i</quote>. To negate the second or right-hand bridi, suffix 
    <quote>-nai</quote>to the JA cmavo. In either case, the negating word is placed on the side of the connective that is closest to the bridi being negated.</para>
    <para>So to express the truth table FTTF, which requires 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>with either of the two bridi negated (not both), we can say either:</para>

    <para>How's that again? Are those two English sentences in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example8" />really equivalent? In English, no. The Lojban TTFT truth function can be glossed 
    <quote>A if B</quote>, but the 
    <quote>if</quote>does not quite have its English sense. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example8" />is true so long as John is a man, even if James is not a woman; likewise, it is true just because James is not a woman, regardless of John's gender. This kind of

    <quote>material conditional</quote>.</para>
    <para>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section1" />), the English sentence 
    <quote>John is a man if James is a woman</quote>seems to be neither true nor false, since it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most convenient to treat this 
    <quote>if</quote>as TTFT, which on investigation means that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example8" />is true. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example9" />, however, is equally true:</para>

    <para>This can be thought of as a principle of consistency, and may be paraphrased as follows: 
    <quote>If a false statement is true, any statement follows from it.</quote>All uses of English 
    <quote>if</quote>must be considered very carefully when translating into Lojban to see if they really fit this Lojban mold.</para>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example10" />, which uses the TFTT truth function, is subject to the same rules: the stated gloss of TFTT as 
    <quote>only if</quote>works naturally only when the right-hand bridi is false; if it is true, the left-hand bridi may be either true or false. The last gloss of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4-example10" />illustrates the use of 
    <quote>if ... then</quote>as a more natural substitute for

    <title>5. Forethought bridi connection</title>
    <para>Many concepts in Lojban are expressible in two different ways, generally referred to as 
    <quote>afterthought</quote>and 
    <quote>forethought</quote>. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section4" />discussed what is called 
    <quote>afterthought bridi logical connection</quote>. The word 
    <quote>afterthought</quote>is used because the connective cmavo and the second bridi were added, as it were, afterwards and without changing the form of the first bridi. This form might be used by someone who makes a statement and then wishes to add or qualify that statement after it has been completed. Thus,</para>

    <para>provides additional information without requiring any change in the form of what has come before; changes which may not be possible or practical, especially in speaking. (The meaning, however, may be changed by the use of a negating connective.) Afterthought connectives make it possible to construct all the important truth-functional relationships in a variety of ways.</para>
    <para>In forethought style the speaker decides in advance, before expressing the first bridi, that a logical connection will be expressed. Forethought and afterthought connectives are expressed with separate selma'o. The forethought logical connectives corresponding to afterthought ijeks are geks:</para>

    </example>
    <para>
    <quote>ga</quote>is the cmavo which represents the 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>truth function in selma'o GA. The word 
    <quote>gi</quote>does not belong to GA at all, but constitutes its own selma'o: it serves only to separate the two bridi without having any content of its own. The English translation of 
    <quote>ga ... gi</quote>is 
    <quote>either ... or</quote>, but in the English form the truth function is specified both by the word 
    <quote>either</quote>and by the word 
    <quote>or</quote>: not so in Lojban.</para>
    <para>Even though two bridi are being connected, geks and giks do not have any 
    <quote>.i</quote>in them. The forethought construct binds up the two bridi into a single sentence as far as the grammar is concerned.</para>

    <para>It is worth emphasizing that

    <quote>gu</quote>which indicates that 
    <quote>la djeimyz. ninmu</quote>may be true or false is unfortunately rather remote from the bridi thus affected.</para>
    <para>Perhaps the most important of the truth functions commonly expressed in forethought is TFTT, which can be paraphrased as 
    <quote>if ... then ...</quote>:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note the placement of the 
    <quote>nai</quote>in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section5-example6" />. When added to afterthought selma'o such as JA, a following 
    <quote>nai</quote>negates the second bridi, to which it is adjacent. Since GA cmavo precede the first bridi, a following 
    <quote>nai</quote>negates the first bridi instead.</para>
    <para>Why does English insist on forethought in the translation of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section5-example6" />? Possibly because it would be confusing to seemingly assert a sentence and then make it conditional (which, as the Lojban form shows, involves a negation). Truth functions which involve negating the first sentence may be confusing, even to the Lojbanic understanding, when expressed using afterthought.</para>
    <para>It must be reiterated here that not every use of English 
    <quote>if ... then</quote>is properly translated by 
    <quote>.inaja</quote>or 
    <quote>ganai ... gi</quote>; anything with implications of time needs a somewhat different Lojban translation, which will be discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section18" />. Causal sentences like 
    <quote>If you feed the pig, then it will grow</quote>are not logical connectives of any type, but rather need a translation using 
    <quote>rinka</quote>as the selbri joining two event abstractions, thus:</para>

    <title>8. Grouping of afterthought connectives</title>
    <para>There are several ways in Lojban to render 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section7-example5" />using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo 
    <quote>bo</quote>(of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if 
    <quote>bo</quote>is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with 
    <quote>bo</quote>are interpreted before connections not so marked. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section8-example1" />is equivalent in meaning to 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section7-example8" />:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>

    <para>The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the 
    <quote>I like Martha</quote>and 
    <quote>I like Mary</quote>sentences are joined by 
    <quote>.ija</quote>first, before the result is joined to 
    <quote>I like John</quote>by 
    <quote>.ije</quote>. Eks can have 
    <quote>bo</quote>attached in exactly the same way, so that 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section8-example2" />is equivalent in meaning to Example 8.1:</para>

    <para>Does this wind up meaning the same as

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section7-example6" />? Not at all. A second rule relating to 
    <quote>bo</quote>is that where several 
    <quote>bo</quote>-marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section8-example3" />in fact means the same as 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section8-example1" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section8-example2" />. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with 
    <quote>bo</quote>should be avoided.</para>
    <para>The use of 
    <quote>bo</quote>, therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section7-example7" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section7-example8" />, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>and 
    <quote>tu'u</quote>are used with ijeks, and 
    <quote>ke</quote>and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote>with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (
    <quote>ke</quote>and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote>are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:</para>

    <para>In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to

    <title>9. Compound bridi</title>
    <para>So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that are identical except for a difference in one sumti (sumti connection). It would seem natural to ask how to logically connect sentences that are identical except for having different selbri.</para>
    <para>Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri connection is provided as part of a more general-purpose mechanism called 
    <quote>compound bridi</quote>. Compound bridi result from logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and possibly some of their sumti.</para>
    <para>The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only common point:</para>

    <quote>mi</quote>fills the x1 place of all three selbri;

    <quote>dejni</quote>, whereas

    <quote>la djan.</quote>is a tail-term shared by 
    <quote>dejni</quote>and by 
    <quote>dunda gi'abo lebna</quote>. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving 
    <quote>la djan.</quote>to the beginning of the sentence, as in

    <title>12. Logical connection within tanru</title>
    <para>As noted at the beginning of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section9" />, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru 
    <quote>blanu zdani</quote>, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of 
    <quote>blanu bolci</quote>, Lojbanists can say 
    <quote>blanu je bolci</quote>, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section11" />also, but there they were always prefixed by 
    <quote>pe'e</quote>; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:</para>

    <title>13. Truth questions and connective questions</title>
    <para>So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.</para>
    <para>The simplest kind of question is of the type 
    <quote>Is it true that ...</quote>where some statement follows. This type is called a 
    <quote>truth question</quote>, and can be represented in English by

    <para>Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by prefixing 
    <quote>Is is true that</quote>to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. 
    <quote>Is Fido a dog?</quote>is the truth question corresponding to 
    <quote>Fido is a dog</quote>. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo 
    <quote>xu</quote>(of selma'o UI) to the statement:</para>

    <para>But that is not what an English-speaker who utters 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section13-example5" />is asking! The true significance of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section13-example5" />is that the speaker desires to know the truth value of either of the two underlying bridi (it is presupposed that only one is true).</para>
    <para>Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them. This is done by using a special question cmavo: there is one of these for each of the logical connective selma'o, as shown by the following table:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    ge'i    GA         forethought connective question
    gi'i    GIhA       bridi-tail connective question

    je'i    JA         tanru connective question
    ji      A          sumti connective question
</programlisting>
    <para>(This list unfortunately departs from the pretty regularity of the other cmavo for logical connection. The two-syllable selma'o, GIhA and GUhA, make use of the cmavo ending in 
    <quote>-i</quote>which is not used for a truth function, but 
    <quote>gi</quote>and 
    <quote>.i</quote>were not available, and different cmavo had to be chosen. This table must simply be memorized, like most other non-connective cmavo assignments.)</para>

    <quote>ko</quote>, which means 
    <quote>you</quote>but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed, and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:</para>

    <para>Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.</para>
    <para>In tanru, 
    <quote>joi</quote>has the connotation 
    <quote>mixed with</quote>, as in the following example:</para>

        <en>This is a blue and red ball.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count as 
    <quote>wholly blue</quote>is an unsettled question, though. A 
    <quote>blanu zdani</quote>may be so even though not every part of it is blue.)</para>
    <para>There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    A joi B     the mass with components A and B
    A ce B      the set with elements A and B
    A ce'o B    the sequence with elements A and B in order
    A sece'o B  the sequence with elements B and A in order
    A jo'u B    A and B considered jointly
    A fa'u B    A and B respectively
    A sefa'u B  B and A respectively
    A jo'e B    the union of sets A and B
    A ku'a B    the intersection of sets A and B
    A pi'u B    the cross product of sets A and B
    A sepi'u B  the cross product of sets B and A
</programlisting>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>se</quote>is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:</para>

    <para>The x2 place of

    <title>17. Logical and non-logical connectives within mekso</title>
    <para>Lojban has a separate grammar embedded within the main grammar for representing mathematical expressions (or mekso in Lojban) such as 
    <quote>2 + 2</quote>. Mathematical expressions are explained fully in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter18" />. The basic components of mekso are operands, like 
    <quote>2</quote>, and operators, like 
    <quote>+</quote>. Both of these may be either logically or non-logically connected.</para>
    <para>Operands are connected in afterthought with eks and in forethought with geks, just like sumti. Operators, on the other hand, are connected in afterthought with jeks and in forethought with guheks, just like tanru components. (However, jeks and joiks with 
    <quote>bo</quote>are not allowed for operators.) This parallelism is no accident.</para>
    <para>In addition, eks with 
    <quote>bo</quote>and with 
    <quote>ke ... ke'e</quote>are allowed for grouping logically connected operands, and 
    <quote>ke ... ke'e</quote>is allowed for grouping logically connected operators, although there is no analogue of tanru among the operators.</para>

    <title>18. Tenses, modals, and logical connection</title>
    <para>The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo 
    <quote>pu</quote>, 
    <quote>ca</quote>, and 
    <quote>ba</quote>(of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a 
    <quote>le nu</quote>abstraction; see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter11" />).</para>
    <para>The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in tense:</para>

    <para>No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by the grammar, nor is there any way to override the default left-grouping rule; these limitations are imposed to keep the tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or modals can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time, place, or mode explicitly, so it is reasonable to try to remove at least some complications.</para>
    <para>Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more important than logical connections between tenses. Consider the English sentence:</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter9" />.) However, the tense information - that the event of my going to the market preceded the event of my buying food - can be added to the logical connective as follows. The 
    <quote>.ije</quote>is replaced by 
    <quote>.ijebo</quote>, and the tense cmavo

    <para>As can be seen from 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section18-example11" />and

    <quote>bo</quote>and 
    <quote>ke</quote>(or 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>) is arbitrary when there are only two things to be connected. If there were no tense information to include, of course neither would be required; it is only the rule that tense information must always be sandwiched between the logical connective and a following 
    <quote>bo</quote>, 
    <quote>ke</quote>, or 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>that requires the use of one of these grouping cmavo in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section18-example7" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section18-example9" />through 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section18-example13" />.</para>
    <para>Non-logical connectives with 
    <quote>bo</quote>and 
    <quote>ke</quote>can include tense information in exactly the same way as logical connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:</para>

    </example>
    <para>is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for use when a tense applies to both of the selbri in a forethought bridi-tail connection: the entire forethought construction can just be preceded by a tense. For example:</para>
