    <para>Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>logical language</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>logical language</quote>. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>logical language</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>sentence</quote> (sometimes called a 
    <quote>statement</quote> or 
    <quote>proposition</quote>), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of 
    <quote>truth functions</quote>, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,</para>

    </example>
    <para>is true if 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true, or if 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether 
    <quote>John is a man or James is a woman</quote> is true, provided we know the meaning of 
    <quote>or</quote>. Here 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> and 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> are the component sentences.</para>
    <para>We will use the phrase 
    <quote>negating a sentence</quote> to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>negating a sentence</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>It is false that ...</quote>, or more idiomatically by inserting 
    <quote>not</quote> at the right point, generally before the verb. 
    <quote>James is not a woman</quote> is the negation of 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote>, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation 
    <quote>Not!</quote></para>
    <para>Words like 
    <quote>or</quote> are called 
    <quote>logical connectives</quote>, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>logical language</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>and</quote>, 
    <quote>and/or</quote>, 
    <quote>if</quote>, 
    <quote>only if</quote>, 
    <quote>whether or not</quote>, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</para>
    <para>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.</para>
    <para>There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for

    <para>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of the result is also false.</para>
    <para>Suppose that 
    <quote>John is a man</quote> is true (and 
    <quote>John is not a man</quote> is false), and that 
    <quote>James is a woman</quote> is false (and

    <para>Note that the kind of 
    <quote>or</quote> used in this example can also be expressed (in formal English) with 
    <quote>and/or</quote>. There is a different truth table for the kind of

    <quote>or</quote> that means

    <para>To save space, we will write truth tables in a shorter format henceforth. Let the letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by reading down the third column of the table above.

    <title>The Four basic vowels</title>
    <para>Lojban regards four of these 16 truth functions as fundamental, and assigns them the four vowels 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>, 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>, and 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>. These letters do not represent actual cmavo or selma'o, but rather a component vowel from which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up, as explained in the next section. Here are the four vowels, their truth tables, and rough English equivalents:</para>
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>truth tables</primary>
    </indexterm>
<para>FIXME: TAG SPOT</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>   TTTF    or, and/or
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>   TFFF    and
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>   TFFT    if and only if
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>   TTFF    whether or not
</programlisting>
    <para>More precisely:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>   is true if either or both sentences are true;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>   is true if both sentences are true, but not otherwise;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>   is true if the sentences are both true or both false;
    
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>   is true if the first sentence is true, regardless of the truth value of the second sentence.
</programlisting>
    <para>With the four vowels, the ability to negate either sentence, and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been reversed, we can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF, which are fairly useless anyway. The following table illustrates how to create each of the 14 remaining truth functions:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    TTTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>
    TTFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with second sentence negated
    TTFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>
    TFTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with first sentence negated
    TFTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with sentences exchanged
    TFFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase>
    TFFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase>

    FTTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> with both sentences negated
    FTTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase> with either first or second negated (not both)
    FTFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with sentences exchanged and then second negated
    FTFF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with second sentence negated
    FFTT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> with first sentence negated
    FFTF   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with first sentence negated
    FFFT   
<phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> with both sentences negated
</programlisting>
    <para>Note that exchanging the sentences is only necessary with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase>. The three other basic truth functions are commutative; that is, they mean the same thing regardless of the order of the component sentences. There are other ways of getting some of these truth tables; these just happen to be the methods usually employed.</para>

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter14-section3">
    <title>The six types of logical connectives</title>
    <para>In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>Consider the English sentence:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-ptgf">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e3d1" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>Mary went to the window and ...</jbo>
        <indexterm type="general">
          <primary>window</primary>
        </indexterm>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>where the last word could be followed by 
    <quote>the door</quote>, a noun phrase, or by 
    <quote>saw the horses</quote>, a sentence with subject omitted, or by 
    <quote>John went to the door</quote>, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</para>
    <para>Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</para>
    <para>Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> is 
    <quote>a</quote>. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase>, which is a truth function, or 
    <quote>a</quote>, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">E</phrase> in selma'o GIhA is 
    <quote>gi'e</quote>, and the cmavo for 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">U</phrase> in selma'o GA is 
    <quote>gu</quote>. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</para>
    <para>Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section1" />. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo 
    <quote>se</quote>, 
    <quote>na</quote>, or 
    <quote>nai</quote>. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para>For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used for logical connection is designated by a Lojban name. The name is derived by changing the final 
    <quote>-A</quote> of the selma'o name to 
    <quote>-ek</quote>; the reasons for using 
    <quote>-ek</quote> are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use 
    <quote>eks</quote> as the plural of 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>plural</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>ek</quote>.) When the term 
    <quote>logical connective</quote> is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.</para>
    <para>Why does the title of this section refer to 
    <quote>six types</quote> when there are only five selma'o? A jek may be preceded by 
    <quote>.i</quote>, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences. The compound produced by 
    <quote>.i</quote> followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.</para>

      <primary>giheks</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>There also exist giks, joiks, ijoiks, and joigiks, which are not logical connectives, but are other kinds of compound cmavo which will be introduced later.</para>

    <para>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in

    <para>In forethought style the speaker decides in advance, before expressing the first bridi, that a logical connection will be expressed.

    <para>
    <quote>ga</quote> is the cmavo which represents the 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">A</phrase> truth function in selma'o GA. The word 
    <quote>gi</quote> does not belong to GA at all, but constitutes its own selma'o: it serves only to separate the two bridi without having any content of its own. The English translation of 
    <quote>ga ... gi</quote> is 
    <quote>either ... or</quote>, but in the English form the truth function is specified both by the word 
    <quote>either</quote> and by the word

    <para>Note the placement of the 
    <quote>nai</quote> in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Xcg1" />. When added to afterthought selma'o such as JA, a following 
    <quote>nai</quote> negates the second bridi, to which it is adjacent. Since GA cmavo precede the first bridi, a following 
    <quote>nai</quote> negates the first bridi instead.</para>
    <para>Why does English insist on forethought in the translation of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Xcg1" />? Possibly because it would be confusing to seemingly assert a sentence and then make it conditional (which, as the Lojban form shows, involves a negation). Truth functions which involve negating the first sentence may be confusing, even to the Lojbanic understanding, when expressed using afterthought.</para>
    <para>It must be reiterated here that not every use of English

      <primary>if ... then</primary>

    <quote>If you feed the pig, then it will grow</quote> are not logical connectives of any type, but rather need a translation using

    <para>Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid 
    <phrase role="logical-vowel">O</phrase> with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.</para>
    <para>In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the

This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:</para>

    <title>Grouping of afterthought connectives</title>
    <para>There are several ways in Lojban to render 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-BSuT" /> using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo 
    <quote>bo</quote> (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if 
    <quote>bo</quote> is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with 
    <quote>bo</quote> are interpreted before connections not so marked. 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Uu7D" /> is equivalent in meaning to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-1Dd2" />:</para>

        <en>I like John, and I like Martha or I like Mary.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the 
    <quote>I like Martha</quote> and 
    <quote>I like Mary</quote> sentences are joined by 
    <quote>.ija</quote> first, before the result is joined to 
    <quote>I like John</quote> by 
    <quote>.ije</quote>.</para>

    <para>Eks can have 
    <quote>bo</quote> attached in exactly the same way, so that 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-JVhK" /> is equivalent in meaning to Example 8.1:</para>

    <para>Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Does this wind up meaning the same as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-mLo1" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-dPcI" />? Not at all. A second rule relating to 
    <quote>bo</quote> is that where several 
    <quote>bo</quote>-marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>right-grouping rule</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-YJeE" /> in fact means the same as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Uu7D" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-JVhK" />. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with 
    <quote>bo</quote> should be avoided.</para>
    <para>The use of 
    <quote>bo</quote>, therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-487z" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-1Dd2" />, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. 
    <quote>tu'e</quote> and 
    <quote>tu'u</quote> are used with ijeks, and 
    <quote>ke</quote> and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote> with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. ( 
    <quote>ke</quote> and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote> are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-aqIg">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e8d4" />

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>where the semantics tells us that the instances of 
    <quote>and</quote> are meant to have higher precedence than that of 
    <quote>if</quote>. If we wish to express 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-aqIg" /> in afterthought, we can say:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-1PSK">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e8d5" />

        <en>I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>marking two of the ijeks with 
    <quote>bo</quote> for high precedence. (The first 
    <quote>bo</quote> is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)</para>
    <para>But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-erTb">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c14e8d6" />

        <gloss>( I kiss you and you kiss me )</gloss>
        <en>if ( I love you and you love me ).</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>where the 
    <quote>tu'e ... tu'u</quote> pairs set off the structure. The cmavo 
    <quote>tu'u</quote> is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-erTb" /> is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.</para>
    <para>In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to 
    <quote>bo</quote> grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.</para>
    <para>Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of 
    <quote>tu'e ... tu'u</quote> parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-0mJM" />, which is instead parallel to

    <para>In

    </example>
    <para>Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-rvUD" />, this compound bridi does not necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are the same. Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>compound bridi</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>zo'e</quote>, which is equivalent to omission) can force the goer and the walker to be identical.</para>
    <para>A strong argument for this convention is provided by analysis of the following example:</para>

    <para>If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying bridi were considered identical, then (since there is nothing special about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5 (means) places would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result that the route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the route from Rome to New York. Inserting 
    <quote>da</quote>, meaning roughly 
    <quote>something</quote>, into the x1 place cures the problem:</para>

    <para>The literal English translation in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-901t" /> is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. 
    <quote>mi</quote> fills the x1 place of all three selbri; 
    <quote>lo rupnu</quote> is the x2 of 
    <quote>dejni</quote>, whereas 
    <quote>le cukta</quote> is a tail-term shared between 
    <quote>dunda</quote> and 
    <quote>lebna</quote>; 
    <quote>la djan.</quote> is a tail-term shared by 
    <quote>dejni</quote> and by 
    <quote>dunda gi'abo lebna</quote>. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving 
    <quote>la djan.</quote> to the beginning of the sentence, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Evo4" />:</para>

    <para>Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:</para>

    <title>Logical connection within tanru</title>
    <para>As noted at the beginning of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section9" />, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru 
    <quote>blanu zdani</quote>, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of 
    <quote>blanu bolci</quote>, Lojbanists can say 
    <quote>blanu je bolci</quote>, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14-section11" /> also, but there they were always prefixed by 
    <quote>pe'e</quote>; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:</para>

    <title>Truth questions and connective questions</title>
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>connective questions</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.</para>
    <para>The simplest kind of question is of the type 
    <quote>Is it true that ...</quote> where some statement follows. This type is called a 
    <quote>truth question</quote>, and can be represented in English by 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-bMjE" />:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-bMjE">

        <jbo>Is it true that Fido is a dog?</jbo>
        <en>Is Fido a dog?</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by prefixing 
    <quote>Is is true that</quote> to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. 
    <quote>Is Fido a dog?</quote> is the truth question corresponding to 
    <quote>Fido is a dog</quote>. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo 
    <quote>xu</quote> (of selma'o UI) to the statement:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-gKaM">

    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-bMjE" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-gKaM" /> are equivalent in meaning.</para>
    <para>A truth question can be answered 
    <quote>yes</quote> or 
    <quote>no</quote>, depending on the truth or falsity, respectively, of the underlying statement. The standard way of saying 
    <quote>yes</quote> in Lojban is 
    <quote>go'i</quote> and of saying 
    <quote>no</quote> is 
    <quote>nago'i</quote>. (The reasons for this rule are explained in

    <para>But that is not what an English-speaker who utters 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-mftC" /> is asking! The true significance of

    <para>Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them.

    <para>However, Chinese does not use logical connectives in the reply to such a question, so the resemblance, though striking, is superficial.</para>
    <para>Truth questions may be used in bridi connection. This form of sentence is perfectly legitimate, and can be interpreted by using the convention that a truth question is true if the answer is

    </indexterm>
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>bridi connection</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>yes</quote> and false if the answer is 
    <quote>no</quote>. Analogously, an imperative sentence (involving the special pro-sumti 
    <quote>ko</quote>, which means 
    <quote>you</quote> but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed, and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:</para>

    <para>Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:</para>

    </example>
    <para>which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a 
    <quote>mass</quote>. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo 
    <quote>joi</quote> (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:</para>

    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-pC5x" /> covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large.

    <xref linkend="chapter-sumti" />.</para>
    <para>Grammatically, 
    <quote>joi</quote> can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:</para>

        <en>The man massed-with the woman go-to the market.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>ku</quote> is the elidable terminator for 
    <quote>le</quote>, which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first 
    <quote>ku</quote> were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see 
    <quote>le nanmu joi</quote> and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second 
    <quote>le</quote> cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.</para>
    <para>Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.</para>
    <para>In tanru,

    <quote>mixed with</quote>, as in the following example:</para>

    <para>There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:</para>

    <para>The x3 place of

    <para>The x2 place of

    <quote>lo liste</quote> means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is 
    <quote>lo porsi</quote>, a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by 
    <quote>ce'o</quote> are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.</para>
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>ce'o</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>So 
    <quote>joi</quote>, 
    <quote>ce</quote>, and

    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>ce'o</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>jo'u</quote> serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals - but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:</para>

    <quote>tu'e</quote> and 
    <quote>tu'u</quote> as general brackets around the whole list. This is related to, but distinct from, their use in

    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>mathematical expressions</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>2 + 2</quote>. Mathematical expressions are explained fully in 
    <xref linkend="chapter-mekso" />. The basic components of mekso are operands, like 
    <quote>2</quote>, and operators, like 
    <quote>+</quote>. Both of these may be either logically or non-logically connected.</para>
    <para>Operands are connected in afterthought with eks and in forethought with geks, just like sumti. Operators, on the other hand, are connected in afterthought with jeks and in forethought with guheks, just like tanru components. (However, jeks and joiks with 
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>guheks</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>bo</quote> are not allowed for operators.) This parallelism is no accident.</para>
    <para>In addition, eks with 
    <quote>bo</quote> and with 
    <quote>ke ... ke'e</quote> are allowed for grouping logically connected operands, and 
    <quote>ke ... ke'e</quote> is allowed for grouping logically connected operators, although there is no analogue of tanru among the operators.</para>
    <para>Only a few examples of each kind of mekso connection will be given. Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in either the mekso or the logical-connective scheme of things. These examples are drawn from

    <title>Tenses, modals, and logical connection</title>
    <para>The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo 
    <quote>pu</quote>, 
    <quote>ca</quote>, and 
    <quote>ba</quote> (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a 
    <quote>le nu</quote> abstraction; see 
    <xref linkend="chapter-abstractions" />).</para>
    <para>The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in tense:</para>

    <para>As can be seen from 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-AhnP" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-GBgP" />, the choice between 
    <quote>bo</quote> and 
    <quote>ke</quote> (or 
    <quote>tu'e</quote>) is arbitrary when there are only two things to be connected. If there were no tense information to include, of course neither would be required; it is only the rule that tense information must always be sandwiched between the logical connective and a following 
    <quote>bo</quote>, 
    <quote>ke</quote>, or 
    <quote>tu'e</quote> that requires the use of one of these grouping cmavo in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-129L" /> and 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-APPE" /> through 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Ce09" />.</para>
    <para>Non-logical connectives with 
    <quote>bo</quote> and 
    <quote>ke</quote> can include tense information in exactly the same way as logical connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:</para>

        <en>Three and, later, four students were in the room.</en>

    </example>
    <para>is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for use when a tense applies to both of the selbri in a forethought bridi-tail connection: the entire forethought construction can just be preceded by a tense. For example:</para>
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>forethought bridi-tail connection</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-DxuA">

    <para>Last and (as a matter of fact) least: a logical connective is allowed between abstraction markers of selma'o NU. As usual, the connection can be expanded to a bridi connection between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. Jeks are the appropriate connective.

    <para>Logical connectives and abstraction are related in another way as well, though. Since an abstraction contains a bridi, the bridi may have a logical connection inside it.
