    <title>What are pro-sumti and pro-bridi? What are they for?</title>
    <para>Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages, require mechanisms of abbreviation. If every time we referred to something, we had to express a complete description of it, life would be too short to say what we have to say. In English, we have words called 
    <quote>pronouns</quote>which allow us to replace nouns or noun phrases with shorter terms. An English with no pronouns might look something like this:</para>

    <para>In Lojban, we have sumti rather than nouns, so our equivalent of pronouns are called by the hybrid term 
<!-- ^^   nouns: brivla as Lojban equivalents, 52 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>nouns</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>pro-sumti</quote>. A purely Lojban term would be 
    <quote>sumti cmavo</quote>: all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In exactly the same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to selma'o GOhA) which serve as selbri or full bridi. These may be called 
    <quote>pro-bridi</quote>or 
    <quote>bridi cmavo</quote>. This chapter explains the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall into a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o KOhA, we have among others the mi-series, the ko'a-series, the da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of pro-sumti is explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi, it is explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't have pro-bridi analogues, however.</para>
    <para>A few technical terms: The term 
<!-- ^^   technical terms, 5 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>technical terms</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>referent</quote>means the thing to which a pro-sumti (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the speaker of a sentence is James, then the referent of the word 
    <quote>I</quote>is James. On the other hand, the term 
    <quote>antecedent</quote>refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi) implicitly repeats. In</para>

    <para>The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. 
    <quote>mi</quote>refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. 
    <quote>do</quote>refers to the listener or listeners. Neither 
    <quote>mi</quote>nor 
    <quote>do</quote>is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as 
<!-- ^^   foreman of a jury: example, 146 -->

    <quote>mi</quote>, since in speaking officially he represents all of them.</para>
    <para>The referents of

    </example>
    <para>In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word 
    <quote>ko</quote>must be used. However, 
    <quote>ko</quote>does not have to appear in the x1 place:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-5Jbi">

    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section2-example5" />, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of 
    <quote>ko</quote>in the x2 place. Indeed, 
    <quote>ko</quote>does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>As mentioned in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section1" />, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.</para>

    <title>Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series</title>
    <para>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
     ti      KOhA  ti-series     this here, a nearby object 
<!-- skip cmavo list automation -->
     ta      KOhA  ti-series     that there, a medium-distant object
     tu      KOhA  ti-series     that yonder, a far-distant object
</programlisting>
    <para>It is often useful to refer to things by pointing to them or by some related non-linguistic mechanism. In English, the words 
    <quote>this</quote>and 
    <quote>that</quote>serve this function among others: 
    <quote>this</quote>refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and 
    <quote>that</quote>refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo 
    <quote>ti</quote>, 
    <quote>ta</quote>, and 
    <quote>tu</quote>provide only the pointing function of 
    <quote>this</quote>and 
    <quote>that</quote>; they are not used to refer to things that cannot be pointed at.</para>
    <para>There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just two because it is often useful to distinguish between objects that are at more than two different distances. Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century, English did too; the pronoun 
    <quote>that</quote>referred to something at a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun 
    <quote>yon</quote>to something far away.</para>
<!-- ^^   yon: as archaic English equivalent of tu, 147 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>yon</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In conversation, there is a special rule about 
    <quote>ta</quote>and 
    <quote>tu</quote>that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, 
    <quote>ta</quote>refers to something that is near the listener, whereas 
    <quote>tu</quote>refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between 
    <quote>ti</quote>and 
    <quote>mi</quote>, and 
    <quote>ta</quote>and 
    <quote>do</quote>, that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what counts as 
    <quote>near</quote>and 
    <quote>far away</quote>is relative to the current situation.</para>
    <para>It is important to distinguish between the English pronoun 
    <quote>this</quote>and the English adjective 
    <quote>this</quote>as in 
    <quote>this boat</quote>. The latter is not represented in Lojban by

<indexterm type="general"><primary>real world</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ko'a</quote>refers to the store; in other words, that its antecedent is

    <quote>la .alis.</quote>is just as likely an antecedent, in which case 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section5-example1" />means that Alice, not the store, is blue.</para>
    <para>To avoid this pitfall, Lojban employs special syntax, using the cmavo

    <para>Syntactically, 
    <quote>goi la .alis.</quote>is a relative phrase (relative phrases are explained in

    <quote>la .alis.</quote>refer to the same thing, and furthermore that this is true because 
    <quote>ko'a</quote>is being defined as meaning

    <para>in other words,

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8" />.</para>
    <para>The afterthought form of 
    <quote>goi</quote>shown in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section5-example2" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section5-example3" />is probably most common in speech, where we do not know until part way through our utterance that we will want to refer to Alice again. In writing, though, 
    <quote>ko'a</quote>may be assigned at the point where Alice is first mentioned. An example of this forethought form of 
    <quote>goi</quote>is:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-1FJV">

<indexterm type="general"><primary>cei</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>goi</quote>in assigning

    <para>Note that pro-bridi are so called because, even though they have the grammar of selbri, their antecedents are whole bridi. In the following rather contrived example, the antecedent of

    <para>In the second bridi,

    <quote>do</quote>overrides the 
    <quote>mi</quote>of the antecedent bridi. Similarly, any tense or negation that is present in the antecedent is also carried, and can be overridden by explicit tense or negation cmavo on the pro-bridi. These rules hold for all pro-bridi that have antecedents.</para>

<indexterm type="general"><primary>anaphora</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>repetition</quote>, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora,

    <quote>ri</quote>, 
    <quote>ra</quote>, and 
    <quote>ru</quote>; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora,

<indexterm type="general"><primary>anaphora</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>go'i</quote>, 
    <quote>go'a</quote>, and 
<!-- ^^   go'a, 154 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>go'a</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>go'u</quote>. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the 
<!-- ^^   go'u, 154 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>go'u</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>distances</quote>referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.</para>
    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>ri</quote>is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the 
    <quote>ri</quote>:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-3som">

        <en>Alice sleeps in her room.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The 
    <quote>ri</quote>in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section6-example1" />is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is 
    <quote>la .alis.</quote>, so 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section6-example1" />is equivalent to:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-bs5R">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c7e6d2" />

      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>la .alis. sipna le la .alis. kumfa</jbo>
        <gloss>Alice sleeps-in the of-Alice room.</gloss>
        <en>Alice sleeps in Alice's room.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Note that 
    <quote>ri</quote>does not repeat 
    <quote>le ri kumfa</quote>, because that sumti is not yet complete when 
    <quote>ri</quote>appears. This prevents 
    <quote>ri</quote>from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like 
    <quote>la alis.</quote>in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section6-example2" />is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.</para>
    <para>Certain sumti are ignored by 
    <quote>ri</quote>; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-CVmN">

        <gloss>I love me.</gloss>
        <en>I love myself.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by 
    <quote>ri</quote>, because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating 
    <quote>ti</quote>may not be effective. Likewise, 
    <quote>ri</quote>itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later 
    <quote>ri</quote>; in fact, a string of 
    <quote>ri</quote>cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Here the second 
    <quote>ri</quote>has as antecedent the first

    <para>To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on,

        <jbo>lo smuci .i lo forca .i la rik. pilno rixire</jbo>

        <gloss>A spoon. A fork. Rick uses [repeat next-to-last].</gloss>
        <en>Alice uses [repeat fifth-from-last].</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here 
    <quote>rixire</quote>, or 
    <quote>ri-sub-2</quote>, skips 
    <quote>la rik.</quote>to reach 
    <quote>lo forca</quote>. In the same way, 
    <quote>riximu</quote>, or 
    <quote>ri-sub-5</quote>, skips 
    <quote>la .alis.</quote>, 
    <quote>rixire</quote>, 
    <quote>la rik.</quote>, and 
    <quote>lo forca</quote>to reach 
    <quote>lo smuci</quote>. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.</para>
    <para>Therefore, the vaguer 
    <quote>ra</quote>and 
    <quote>ru</quote>are also provided. The cmavo 
    <quote>ra</quote>repeats a recently used sumti, and 
    <quote>ru</quote>one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of 
    <quote>ra</quote>and 
    <quote>ru</quote>forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can 
    <quote>ra</quote>refer to the last sumti, like 
    <quote>ri</quote>? The answer is no if 
    <quote>ri</quote>has also been used. If 
    <quote>ri</quote>has not been used, then 
    <quote>ra</quote>might be the last sumti. Likewise, if 
    <quote>ra</quote>has been used, then any use of 
    <quote>ru</quote>would repeat a sumti earlier than the one 
    <quote>ra</quote>is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 6.5, but one that depends more on context, is:</para>

        <gloss>.i la .alis. pilno ru</gloss>
        <gloss>A spoon. A fork. Rick uses [some previous thing].</gloss>
        <en>Alice uses [some more remote thing].</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section6-example6" />, the use of 
    <quote>ra</quote>tells us that something other than 
    <quote>la rik.</quote>is the antecedent; 
    <quote>lo forca</quote>is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of 
    <quote>ru</quote>must be something even further back in the utterance than 
    <quote>lo forca</quote>, and 
    <quote>lo smuci</quote>is the obvious candidate.</para>
    <para>The meaning of 
    <quote>ri</quote>must be determined every time it is used. Since 
    <quote>ra</quote>and 
    <quote>ru</quote>are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by 
    <quote>ri</quote>, 
    <quote>ra</quote>, or 
    <quote>ru</quote>, use 
    <quote>goi</quote>and a ko'a-series cmavo:</para>

    <quote>ko'a</quote>being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.</para>

    <quote>ri</quote>, 
    <quote>ra</quote>, and 
    <quote>ru</quote>, except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti - specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes 
    <quote>go'i</quote>by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:</para>

    <para>Note:

    <title>lujvo based on pro-sumti</title>
    <para>There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7-section16" />for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.</para>
    <para>Thus 
    <quote>donta'a</quote>, meaning

<!-- ^^   you-cmavo: example, 163 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>you-cmavo</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm type="general"><primary>anticipated</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Finally, lujvo involving 
    <quote>zi'o</quote>are also possible, and are fully discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter12" />. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for 
    <quote>zi'o</quote>as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a 
<!-- ^^   beverage: example, 163 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>beverage</primary></indexterm>
<!-- ^^   anyone: contrasted with everyone in assumption of existence, 399 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>anyone</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>se pinxe be zi'o</quote>, the lujvo corresponding to this is 
    <quote>zilrelselpinxe</quote>(deleting the second place of 
    <quote>se pinxe</quote>). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that 
    <quote>zilpavypinxe</quote>has the same place structure as 
    <quote>zilrelselpinxe</quote>, and 
    <quote>lo zilpavypinxe</quote>, like 
    <quote>lo zilrelselpinxe</quote>, refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.</para>

<indexterm type="general"><primary>co'e</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>du</quote>, and 
    <quote>bu'a</quote>also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for 
    <quote>du</quote>-based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.</para>
