  <title>Chapter 10 Imaginary Journeys: The Lojban Space/Time Tense System</title>
  <section xml:id="cll_chapter10-section1">
    <title>1. Introductory</title>
    <para>This chapter attempts to document and explain the space/time tense system of Lojban. It does not attempt to answer all questions of the form 
<!-- ^^   tense system: and space location, 215 -->
<indexterm><primary>tense system</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>How do I say such-and-such (an English tense) in Lojban?</quote>Instead, it explores the Lojban tense system from the inside, attempting to educate the reader into a Lojbanic viewpoint. Once the overall system is understood and the resources that it makes available are familiar, the reader should have some hope of using appropriate tense constructs and being correctly understood.</para>

<indexterm><primary>tense system</primary></indexterm>
    <para>The system of Lojban tenses presented here may seem really complex because of all the pieces and all the options; indeed, this chapter is the longest one in this book. But tense is in fact complex in every language. In your native language, the subtleties of tense are intuitive. In foreign languages, you are seldom taught the entire system until you have reached an advanced level. Lojban tenses are extremely systematic and productive, allowing you to express subtleties based on what they mean rather than on how they act similarly to English tenses. This chapter concentrates on presenting an intuitive approach to the meaning of Lojban tense words and how they may be creatively and productively combined.</para>
    <para>What is 
    <quote>tense</quote>? Historically, 
    <quote>tense</quote>is the attribute of verbs in English and related languages that expresses the time of the action. In English, three tenses are traditionally recognized, conventionally called the past, the present, and the future. There are also a variety of compound tenses used in English. However, there is no simple relationship between the form of an English tense and the time actually expressed:</para>

<indexterm><primary>verbs</primary></indexterm>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
       I go to London tomorrow.

<indexterm><primary>tomorrow</primary></indexterm>
       I will go to London tomorrow.
<!-- ^^   tomorrow: example, 282 -->
<indexterm><primary>tomorrow</primary></indexterm>
       I am going to London tomorrow.
<!-- ^^   tomorrow: example, 282 -->
<indexterm><primary>tomorrow</primary></indexterm>
</programlisting>
    <para>all mean the same thing, even though the first sentence uses the present tense; the second, the future tense; and the third, a compound tense usually called

    <quote>present progressive</quote>. Likewise, a newspaper headline says 
    <quote>JONES DIES</quote>, although it is obvious that the time referred to must be in the past. Tense is a mandatory category of English: every sentence must be marked for tense, even if in a way contrary to logic, because every main verb has a tense marker built into to it. By contrast, Lojban brivla have no implicit tense marker attached to them.</para>
    <para>In Lojban, the concept of tense extends to every selbri, not merely the verb-like ones. In addition, tense structures provide information about location in space as well as in time. All tense information is optional in Lojban: a sentence like:</para>

        <en>I go-to the market.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>can be understood as:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
      I went to the market.
      I am going to the market.
      I have gone to the market.
      I will go to the market.
      I continually go to the market.
</programlisting>
    <para>as well as many other possibilities: context resolves which is correct.</para>
    <para>The placement of a tense construct within a Lojban bridi is easy: right before the selbri. It goes immediately after the 
    <quote>cu</quote>, and can in fact always replace the 
    <quote>cu</quote>(although in very complex sentences the rules for eliding terminators may be changed as a result). In the following examples, 
    <quote>pu</quote>is the tense marker for 
    <quote>past time</quote>:</para>

        <en>I went to the market.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>It is also possible to put the tense somewhere else in the bridi by adding 
    <quote>ku</quote>after it. This 
    <quote>ku</quote>is an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to actually elide it except at the end of the bridi:</para>

<indexterm><primary>time tenses</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section1" />, asks the reader? Because the model to be used in explaining both will be easier to grasp for space than for time. The explanation of time tenses will resume in

    <para>English doesn't have mandatory spatial tenses. Although there are plenty of ways in English of showing where an event happens, there is absolutely no need to do so. Considering this fact may give the reader a feel for what the optional Lojban time tenses are like. From the Lojban point of view, space and time are interchangeable, although they are not treated identically.</para>

    <para>Lojban specifies the spatial tense of a bridi (the place at which it occurs) by using words from selma'o FAhA and VA to describe an imaginary journey from the speaker to the place referred to. FAhA cmavo specify the direction taken in the journey, whereas VA cmavo specify the distance gone. For example:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-hNAJ">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c10e2d1" />

      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le nanmu va batci le gerku</jbo>
        <gloss>The man [medium distance] bites the dog.</gloss>
        <en>Over there the man is biting the dog.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>What is at a medium distance? The event referred to by the bridi: the man biting the dog. What is this event at a medium distance from? The speaker's location. We can understand the 
    <quote>va</quote>as saying: 
    <quote>If you want to get from the speaker's location to the location of the bridi, journey for a medium distance (in some direction unspecified).</quote>This 
    <quote>imaginary journey</quote>can be used to understand not only 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section2-example1" />, but also every other spatial tense construct.</para>
    <para>Suppose you specify a direction with a FAhA cmavo, rather than a distance with a VA cmavo:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-5Qxr">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c10e2d2" />

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le nanmu zu'a batci le gerku</jbo>
        <en>The man [left] bites the dog.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here the imaginary journey is again from the speaker's location to the location of the bridi, but it is now performed by going to the left (in the speaker's reference frame) for an unspecified distance. So a reasonable translation is:</para>
<!-- ^^   reference frame: specifying for direction tenses, 224 -->
<indexterm><primary>reference frame</primary></indexterm>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
       To my left, the man bites the dog.
</programlisting>
    <para>The 
    <quote>my</quote>does not have an explicit equivalent in the Lojban, because the speaker's location is understood as the starting point.</para>
    <para>(Etymologically, by the way, 
    <quote>zu'a</quote>is derived from 
    <quote>zunle</quote>, the gismu for 
    <quote>left</quote>, whereas 
    <quote>vi</quote>, 
    <quote>va</quote>, and 
    <quote>vu</quote>are intended to be reminiscent of 
    <quote>ti</quote>,

    <quote>this-here</quote>, 
    <quote>that-there</quote>, and 
    <quote>that-yonder</quote>.)</para>
    <para>What about specifying both a direction and a distance? The rule here is that the direction must come before the distance:</para>

        <en>Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>As explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section1" />, it would be perfectly correct to use 
    <quote>ku</quote>to move this tense to the beginning or the end of the sentence to emphasize it:</para>

    <title>3. Compound spatial tenses</title>
    <para>Humph, says the reader: this talk of 
    <quote>imaginary journeys</quote>is all very well, but what's the point of it? - 
    <quote>zu'a</quote>means 
    <quote>on the left</quote>and 
    <quote>vi</quote>means 
    <quote>nearby</quote>, and there's no more to be said. The imaginary-journey model becomes more useful when so-called compound tenses are involved. A compound tense is exactly like a simple tense, but has several FAhAs run together:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The proper interpretation of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section3-example1" />is that the imaginary journey has two stages: first move from the speaker's location upward, and then to the left. A translation might read:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
       Left of a place above me, the man bites the dog.
</programlisting>
    <para>(Perhaps the speaker is at the bottom of a manhole, and the dog-biting is going on at the edge of the street.)</para>
<!-- ^^   manhole: example, 218 -->
<indexterm><primary>manhole</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In the English translation, the keywords 
    <quote>left</quote>and 
    <quote>above</quote>occur in reverse order to the Lojban order. This effect is typical of what happens when we 
    <quote>unfold</quote>Lojban compound tenses into their English equivalents, and shows why it is not very useful to try to memorize a list of Lojban tense constructs and their colloquial English equivalents.</para>
    <para>The opposite order also makes sense:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In ordinary space, the result of going up and then to the left is the same as that of going left and then up, but such a simple relationship does not apply in all environments or to all directions: going south, then east, then north may return one to the starting point, if that point is the North Pole.</para>
    <para>Each direction can have a distance following:</para>

    <para>A distance can also come at the beginning of the tense construct, without any specified direction. (

    <para>Now that the reader understands spatial tenses, there are only two main facts to understand about temporal tenses: they work exactly like the spatial tenses, with selma'o PU and ZI standing in for FAhA and VA; and when both spatial and temporal tense cmavo are given in a single tense construct, the temporal tense is expressed first. (If space could be expressed before or after time at will, then certain constructions would be ambiguous.)</para>

        <en>The man bit the dog.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>means that to reach the dog-biting, you must take an imaginary journey through time, moving towards the past an unspecified distance. (Of course, this journey is even more imaginary than the ones talked about in the previous sections, since time-travel is not an available option.)</para>
    <para>Lojban recognizes three temporal directions: 
    <quote>pu</quote>for the past, 
    <quote>ca</quote>for the present, and 
    <quote>ba</quote>for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the corresponding gismu 
    <quote>purci</quote>, 
    <quote>cabna</quote>, and 
    <quote>balvi</quote>. See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section23" />for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.) There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute and relative directions as well as 
<!-- ^^   spatial directions: list of, 253 -->
<indexterm><primary>spatial directions</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>direction-like relationships</quote>like 
    <quote>surrounding</quote>, 
    <quote>within</quote>, 
    <quote>touching</quote>, etc. (See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section27" />for a complete list.) But there are really only two directions in time: forward and backward, toward the future and toward the past. Why, then, are there three cmavo of selma'o PU?</para>
    <para>The reason is that tense is subjective: human beings perceive space and time in a way that does not necessarily agree with objective measurements. We have a sense of 
<!-- ^^   measurements: expressing, 435 -->
<indexterm><primary>measurements</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>now</quote>which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future, and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the 
    <quote>zero direction</quote>, Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction: 
    <quote>bu'u</quote>, which means something like

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section4-example5" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section4-example6" />are perfectly legitimate, but may not be very much used:

    <quote>about now, but not exactly now</quote>.</para>
    <para>Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of events happening in an unspecified space direction ( 
    <quote>nearby</quote>or 
    <quote>far away</quote>), but we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens 
    <quote>nearby in time</quote>is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.</para>

    <para>The cmavo of ZEhA are sufficient to express time intervals. One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify that a motion 
    <quote>in a small space</quote>is more specifically 
    <quote>in a short line</quote>, 
    <quote>in a small area</quote>, or

    <para>The reader may wish to raise a philosophical point here. (Readers who don't wish to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called 
<!-- ^^   irrelevant: specifying of sumti place, 157 -->
<indexterm><primary>irrelevant</primary></indexterm>
<!-- ^^   dimension: meaning as sumti tcita, 233 -->
<indexterm><primary>dimension</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>vi'a</quote>, because relatively speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface. Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a single mountain) would be properly described with 
<!-- ^^   vi'a, 224 -->
<indexterm><primary>vi'a</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>vi'u</quote>. So the cognitive, rather than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.</para>

<indexterm><primary>dimensionality</primary></indexterm>
    <para>VIhA has a member 
    <quote>vi'e</quote>which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time considered as an Einsteinian whole.

    <para>It is necessary to be careful with sentences like 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section9-example6" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section9-example8" />, where a quantified tense appears without an interval. What

The example says nothing about what happened outside that vague time interval. This is often less than we mean. If we want to nail down that I went to the market once and only once, we can use the cmavo

    <para>The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what is traditionally called 
    <quote>aspect</quote>. This is not a notion well expressed by English tenses, but many languages (including Chinese and Russian among Lojban's six source languages) consider it more important than the specification of mere position in time.</para>

    <para>The 
    <quote>event contours</quote>of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre keywords, represent the natural portions of an event considered as a process, an occurrence with an internal structure including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords are scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in detail here. Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO afterward. The imaginary journey described by other tense cmavo moves us to the portion of the event-as-process which the ZAhO specifies.</para>

    <para>It is important to understand that ZAhO cmavo, unlike the other tense cmavo, specify characteristic portions of the event, and are seen from an essentially timeless perspective. The 
    <quote>beginning</quote>of an event is the same whether the event is in the speaker's present, past, or future. It is especially important not to confuse the speaker-relative viewpoint of the PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of the ZAhO tenses.</para>

    <para>As discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section6" />, the simple PU cmavo make no assumptions about whether the scope of a past, present, or future event extends into one of the other tenses as well.

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section10-example1" />through

    <para>Note that in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section10-example1" />and

<indexterm><primary>future event</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ba'o</quote>, connected with 
    <quote>ba</quote>, is referring to a past event. This is the natural result of the event-centered view of ZAhO cmavo. The inchoative, or 
<!-- ^^   past event: possible extension into present, 223 -->
<indexterm><primary>past event</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>pu'o</quote>, part of an event, is in the 
    <quote>pastward</quote>portion of that event, when seen from the perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that we suppose that 
<!-- ^^   pastward: as a spatial tense, 224 -->
<indexterm><primary>pastward</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section10-example1" />refers to the speaker's future: in fact, no PU tense is given, so the inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the speaker's present: 
    <quote>pu'o</quote>is not necessarily, though in fact often is, the same as

    <para>Many natural languages represent time by a space-based metaphor: in English, what is past is said to be

Here, Lojban is representing space (or space interval modifiers) by a time-based metaphor: the choice of a FAhA cmavo following a VEhA cmavo indicates which direction is mapped onto the future. (The choice of future rather than past is arbitrary, but convenient for English-speakers.)</para>

    <para>So far we have only considered tenses in isolated bridi. Lojban provides several ways for a tense to continue in effect over more than a single bridi. This property is known as 
    <quote>stickiness</quote>: the tense gets 
    <quote>stuck</quote>and remains in effect until explicitly 
    <quote>unstuck</quote>. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood. Later imaginary journeys start from that point rather than from the speaker.</para>

    <quote>ki</quote>to it:</para>

    <para>Here the use of

    <para>Lojban has several ways of embedding a bridi within another bridi: descriptions, abstractors, relative clauses. (Technically, descriptions contain selbri rather than bridi.) Any of the selbri of these subordinate bridi may have tenses attached. These tenses are interpreted relative to the tense of the main bridi:</para>

    <para>The significance of the

    <para>
    <quote>ki</quote>may also be used as a tense by itself. This cancels all stickiness and returns the bridi and all following bridi to the speaker's location in both space and time.</para>
    <para>In complex descriptions, multiple tenses may be saved and then used by adding a subscript to

    <quote>ki</quote>. A time made sticky with 
    <quote>kixipa</quote>(ki-sub-1) can be returned to by specifying 
    <quote>kixipa</quote>as a tense by itself. In the case of written expression, the writer's here-and-now is often different from the reader's, and a pair of subscripted 
    <quote>ki</quote>tenses could be used to distinguish the two.</para>

    <title>14. Story time</title>
    <para>Making strict use of the conventions explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section13" />would be intolerably awkward when a story is being told. The time at which a story is told by the narrator is usually unimportant to the story. What matters is the flow of time within the story itself. The term

    <para>Lojban speakers use a different set of conventions, commonly called 
    <quote>story time</quote>, for inferring tense within a story. It is presumed that the event described by each sentence takes place some time more or less after the previous ones. Therefore, tenseless sentences are implicitly tensed as

    <para>If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and making it sticky.

    <quote>said</quote>, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense 
    <quote>went</quote>; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense

    <para>The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks

    <para>Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10-section15-example1" />through

    <para>A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before

    <para>

    <para>Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter9" />. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.</para>

    <para>It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes: small, medium, or large. In order to express both an origin point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction called a 
    <quote>termset</quote>is employed. (Termsets are explained further in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter14" />and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter16" />.) It is grammatical for a termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey and its distance to be specified. Here is an example:</para>
