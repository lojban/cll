  <title>Dog House And White House: Determining lujvo Place Structures</title>

    <title>Why have lujvo?</title>
    <para>The Lojban vocabulary is founded on its list of 1350-plus gismu, made up by combining word lists from various sources. These gismu are not intended to be either a complete vocabulary for the language nor a minimal list of semantic primitives. Instead, the gismu list serves as a basis for the creation of compound words, or lujvo. The intention is that (except in certain semantically broad but shallow fields such as cultures, nations, foods, plants, and animals) suitable lujvo can be devised to cover the ten million or so concepts expressible in all the world's languages taken together. Grammatically, lujvo behave just like gismu: they have place structures and function as selbri.</para>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>compared with tanru</secondary></indexterm> There is a close relationship between lujvo and tanru. In fact, lujvo are condensed forms of tanru:</para>

        <gloss>That is-fire waste.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>contains a tanru which can be reduced to the lujvo in:</para>

        <gloss>That is-fire-waste.</gloss>
        <gloss>That is-ashes.</gloss>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Although the lujvo 
    <valsi>fagyfesti</valsi> is derived from the tanru 
    <jbophrase>fagri festi</jbophrase>, it is not equivalent in meaning to it. In particular, 
    <valsi>fagyfesti</valsi> has a distinct place structure of its own, not the same as that of 
    <valsi>festi</valsi>. (In contrast, the tanru does have the same place structure as 
    <valsi>festi</valsi>.) The lujvo needs to take account of the places of 
    <valsi>fagri</valsi> as well. When a tanru is made into a lujvo, there is no equivalent of 
    <valsi>be</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>bei</valsi>&hellip;<valsi>be'o</valsi> (described in 
    <xref linkend="section-be-sumti"/>) to incorporate sumti into the middle of the lujvo.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>rationale for</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>creative understanding</primary></indexterm> So why have lujvo? Primarily to reduce semantic ambiguity. On hearing a tanru, there is a burden on the listener to figure out what the tanru might mean. Adding further terms to the tanru reduces ambiguity in one sense, by providing more information; but it increases ambiguity in another sense, because there are more and more tanru joints, each with an ambiguous significance. Since lujvo, like other brivla, have a fixed place structure and a single meaning, encapsulating a commonly-used tanru into a lujvo relieves the listener of the burden of creative understanding. In addition, lujvo are typically shorter than the corresponding tanru.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>guidelines</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>guidelines for place structure</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>absolute laws</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>alternative guidelines</primary></indexterm> There are no absolute laws fixing the place structure of a newly created lujvo. The maker must consider the place structures of all the components of the tanru and then decide which are still relevant and which can be removed. What is said in this chapter represents guidelines, presented as one possible standard, not necessarily complete, and not the only possible standard. There may well be lujvo that are built without regard for these guidelines, or in accordance with entirely different guidelines, should such alternative guidelines someday be developed. The reason for presenting any guidelines at all is so that Lojbanists have a starting point for deciding on a likely place structure &ndash; one that others seeing the same word can also arrive at by similar consideration.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>cmavo incorporation</secondary></indexterm> If the tanru includes connective cmavo such as 
    <valsi>bo</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>, 
    <valsi>ke'e</valsi>, or 
    <valsi>je</valsi>, or conversion or abstraction cmavo such as 
    <valsi>se</valsi> or 
    <valsi>nu</valsi>, there are ways of incorporating them into the lujvo as well. Sometimes this makes the lujvo excessively long; if so, the cmavo may be dropped. This leads to the possibility that more than one tanru could produce the same lujvo. Typically, however, only one of the possible tanru is useful enough to justify making a lujvo for it.</para>
    <para>The exact workings of the lujvo-making algorithm, which takes a tanru built from gismu (and possibly cmavo) and produces a lujvo from it, are described in 
    <xref linkend="section-lujvo-making"/>.</para>

  <section xml:id="section-tanru-meanings">
    <title>The meaning of tanru: a necessary detour</title>
    
    <para>The meaning of a lujvo is controlled by &ndash; but is not the same as &ndash; the meaning of the tanru from which the lujvo was constructed. The tanru corresponding to a lujvo is called its 
    <valsi>veljvo</valsi> in Lojban, and since there is no concise English equivalent, that term will be used in this chapter. Furthermore, the left (modifier) part of a tanru will be called the 
    <valsi>seltau</valsi>, and the right (modified) part the 
    <valsi>tertau</valsi>, following the usage of 
    <xref linkend="chapter-selbri"/>. For brevity, we will speak of the seltau or tertau of a lujvo, meaning of course the seltau or tertau of the veljvo of that lujvo. (If this terminology is confusing, substituting 
    <quote>modifier</quote> for 
    <valsi>seltau</valsi> and 
    <quote>modified</quote> for 
    <valsi>tertau</valsi> may help.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>place structure of</secondary></indexterm> The place structure of a tanru is always the same as the place structure of its tertau. As a result, the meaning of the tanru is a modified version of the meaning of the tertau; the tanru will typically, but not always, refer to a subset of the things referred to by the tertau.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>purpose</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>wine-dark sea</primary></indexterm> The purpose of a tanru is to join concepts together without necessarily focusing on the exact meaning of the seltau. For example, in the 
    <citetitle>Iliad</citetitle>, the poet talks about 
    <quote>the wine-dark sea</quote>, in which 
    
    <quote>wine</quote> is a seltau relative to 
    <quote>dark</quote>, and the pair of words is a seltau relative to 
    <quote>sea</quote>. We're talking about the sea, not about wine or color. The other words are there to paint a scene in the listener's mind, in which the real action will occur, and to evoke relations to other sagas of the time similarly describing the sea. Logical inferences about wine or color will be rejected as irrelevant.</para>

<indexterm type="general"><primary>goer-house</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

 As a simple example, consider the rather non-obvious tanru 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase>, or 
    <quote>goer-house</quote>. The gismu 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> has two places:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-xcfi">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e2d1"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>x1 is a nest/house/lair/den for inhabitant x2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>(but in this chapter we will use simply 
    <quote>house</quote>, for brevity), and the gismu 
    <valsi>klama</valsi> has five:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-zUVg">

      </title>
      <para><definition>x1 goes to destination x2 from origin point x3 via route x4 using means x5</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>The tanru 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase> will also have two places, namely those of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. Since a 
    <jbophrase>klama zdani</jbophrase> is a type of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, we can assume that all goer-houses &ndash; whatever they may be &ndash; are also houses.</para>
    <para> 

<indexterm type="general"><primary>dog house</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>tanru</primary><secondary>possible meanings of</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>fleas</primary></indexterm> But is knowing the places of the tertau everything that is needed to understand the meaning of a tanru? No. To see why, let us switch to a less unlikely tanru: 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, literally 
    <quote>dog house</quote>. A tanru expresses a very loose relation: a 
    
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> is a house that has something to do with some dog or dogs. What the precise relation might be is left unstated. Thus, the meaning of 
    <jbophrase>lo gerku zdani</jbophrase> can include all of the following: houses occupied by dogs, houses shaped by dogs, dogs which are also houses (e.g. houses for fleas), houses named after dogs, and so on. All that is essential is that the place structure of 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> continues to apply.</para>
    
    <para>For something (call it z1) to qualify as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> in Lojban, it's got to be a house, first of all. For it to be a house, it's got to house someone (call that z2). Furthermore, there's got to be a dog somewhere (called g1). For g1 to count as a dog in Lojban, it's got to belong to some breed as well (called g2). And finally, for z1 to be in the first place of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, as opposed to just 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, there's got to be some relationship (called r) between some place of 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> and some place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>. It doesn't matter which places, because if there's a relationship between some place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> and any place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>, then that relationship can be compounded with the relationship between the places of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>- namely, 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> itself &ndash; to reach any of the other 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> places. Thus, if the relationship turns out to be between z2 and g2, we can still state r in terms of z1 and g1: 
    <quote>the relationship involves the dog g1, whose breed has to do with the occupant of the house z1</quote>.</para>
    <para> 


 Doubtless to the relief of the reader, here's an illustration. We want to find out whether the White House (the one in which the U. S. President lives, that is) counts as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>. We go through the five variables. The White House is the z1. It houses Bill Clinton as z2, as of this writing, so it counts as a 
    
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>. Let's take a dog &ndash; say, Spot (g1). Spot has to have a breed; let's say it's a Saint Bernard (g2). Now, the White House counts as a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> if there is any relationship (r) at all between the White House and Spot. (We'll choose the g1 and z1 places to relate by r; we could have chosen any other pair of places, and simply gotten a different relationship.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>Chelsea Clinton</primary></indexterm> The sky is the limit for r; it can be as complicated as 
    <quote>The other day, g1 (Spot) chased Socks, who is owned by Chelsea Clinton, who is the daughter of Bill Clinton, who lives in z1 (the White House)</quote> or even worse. If no such r can be found, well, you take another dog, and keep going until no more dogs can be found. Only then can we say that the White House cannot fit into the first place of 
    
    
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para>As we have seen, no less than five elements are involved in the definition of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>: the house, the house dweller, the dog, the dog breed (everywhere a dog goes in Lojban, a dog breed follows), and the relationship between the house and the dog. Since tanru are explicitly ambiguous in Lojban, the relationship r cannot be expressed within a tanru (if it could, it wouldn't be a tanru any more!) All the other places, however, can be expressed &ndash; thus:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>derogatory terms</primary></indexterm> Not the most elegant sentence ever written in either Lojban or English. Yet if there is any relation at all between Spot and the White House, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-tUDa"/> is arguably true. If we concentrate on just one type of relation in interpreting the tanru 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, then the meaning of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> changes. So if we understand 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> as having the same meaning as the English word 
    <quote>doghouse</quote>, the White House would no longer be a 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase> with respect to Spot, because as far as we know Spot does not actually live in the White House, and the White House is not a doghouse (derogatory terms for incumbents notwithstanding).</para>

  <section xml:id="section-lujvo-meanings">
    <title>The meaning of lujvo</title>
    <para>This is a fairly long way to go to try and work out how to say 
    <quote>doghouse</quote>! The reader can take heart; we're nearly there. Recall that one of the components involved in fixing the meaning of a tanru &ndash; the one left deliberately vague &ndash; is the precise relation between the tertau and the seltau. Indeed, fixing this relation is tantamount to giving an interpretation to the ambiguous tanru.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>and seltau/tertau relationship</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>interpreting</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>disambiguated instance</primary></indexterm> A lujvo is defined by a single disambiguated instance of a tanru. That is to say, when we try to design the place structure of a lujvo, we don't need to try to discover the relation between the tertau and the seltau. We already know what kind of relation we're looking for; it's given by the specific need we wish to express, and it determines the place structure of the lujvo itself.</para>
    
    <para>Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to simply devise lujvo and decide on place structures for them without considering one or more specific usages for the coinage. If one does not consider specifics, one will be likely to make erroneous generalizations on the relationship r.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>design consideration for relationship</secondary></indexterm> The insight driving the rest of this chapter is this: while the relation expressed by a tanru can be very distant (e.g. Spot chasing Socks, above), the relationship singled out for disambiguation in a lujvo should be quite close. This is because lujvo-making, paralleling natural language compounding, picks out the most salient relationship r between a tertau place and a seltau place to be expressed in a single word. The relationship 
    <quote>dog chases cat owned by daughter of person living in house</quote> is too distant, and too incidental, to be likely to need expression as a single short word; the relationship 
    <quote>dog lives in house</quote> is not. From all the various interpretations of 
    <jbophrase>gerku zdani</jbophrase>, the person creating 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> should pick the most useful value of r. The most useful one is usually going to be the most obvious one, and the most obvious one is usually the closest one.</para>
    <para>In fact, the relationship will almost always be so close that the predicate expressing r will be either the seltau or the tertau predicate itself. This should come as no surprise, given that a word like 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> in Lojban is a predicate. Predicates express relations; so when you're looking for a relation to tie together 
    <jbophrase>le zdani</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>le gerku</jbophrase>, the most obvious relation to pick is the very relation named by the tertau, 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>: the relation between a home and its dweller. As a result, the object which fills the first place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> (the dog) also fills the second place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi> (the house-dweller).</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>dropping redundant places</secondary></indexterm> The seltau-tertau relationship in the veljvo is expressed by the seltau or tertau predicate itself. Therefore, at least one of the seltau places is going to be equivalent to a tertau place. This place is thus redundant, and can be dropped from the place structure of the lujvo. As a corollary, the precise relationship between the veljvo components can be implicitly determined by finding one or more places to overlap in this way.</para>
    <para>So what is the place structure of 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi>? We're left with three places, since the dweller, the 
    <jbophrase>se zdani</jbophrase>, turned out to be identical to the dog, the 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>. We can proceed as follows:</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>notation conventions</secondary></indexterm> (The notation introduced casually in 
    <xref linkend="section-tanru-meanings"/> will be useful in the rest of this chapter. Rather than using the regular x1, x2, etc. to represent places, we'll use the first letter of the relevant gismu in place of the 
    <quote>x</quote>, or more than one letter where necessary to resolve ambiguities. Thus, z1 is the first place of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, and g2 is the second place of 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>.)</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>explicated walk-through</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>new notation</primary></indexterm> The place structure of

    <para>But z2 is the same as g1; therefore, the tentative place structure for

    <para>Despite the apparently conclusive nature of 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Wx42"/>, our task is not yet done: we still need to decide whether any of the remaining places should also be eliminated, and what order the lujvo places should appear in. These concerns will be addressed in the remainder of the chapter; but we are now equipped with the terminology needed for those discussions.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-selecting-places">
    <title>Selecting places</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>basis of</secondary></indexterm> The set of places of an ordinary lujvo are selected from the places of its component gismu. More precisely, the places of such a lujvo are derived from the set of places of the component gismu by eliminating unnecessary places, until just enough places remain to give an appropriate meaning to the lujvo. In general, including a place makes the concept expressed by a lujvo more general; excluding a place makes the concept more specific, because omitting the place requires assuming a standard value or range of values for it.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>rationale for standardization</secondary></indexterm> It would be possible to design the place structure of a lujvo from scratch, treating it as if it were a gismu, and working out what arguments contribute to the notion to be expressed by the lujvo. There are two reasons arguing against doing so and in favor of the procedure detailed in this chapter.</para>
    <para>The first is that it might be very difficult for a hearer or reader, who has no preconceived idea of what concept the lujvo is intended to convey, to work out what the place structure actually is. Instead, he or she would have to make use of a lujvo dictionary every time a lujvo is encountered in order to work out what a 
    <jbophrase>se jbopli</jbophrase> or a 
    <jbophrase>te klagau</jbophrase> is. But this would mean that, rather than having to learn just the 1300-odd gismu place structures, a Lojbanist would also have to learn myriads of lujvo place structures with little or no apparent pattern or regularity to them. The purpose of the guidelines documented in this chapter is to apply regularity and to make it conventional wherever possible.</para>
    <para>The second reason is related to the first: if the veljvo of the lujvo has not been properly selected, and the places for the lujvo are formulated from scratch, then there is a risk that some of the places formulated may not correspond to any of the places of the gismu used in the veljvo of the lujvo. If that is the case &ndash; that is to say, if the lujvo places are not a subset of the veljvo gismu places &ndash; then it will be very difficult for the hearer or reader to understand what a particular place means, and what it is doing in that particular lujvo. This is a topic that will be further discussed in 
    <xref linkend="section-anomalous-lujvo"/>.</para>
    <para>However, second-guessing the place structure of the lujvo is useful in guiding the process of subsequently eliminating places from the veljvo. If the Lojbanist has an idea of what the final place structure should look like, he or she should be able to pick an appropriate veljvo to begin with, in order to express the idea, and then to decide which places are relevant or not relevant to expressing that idea.</para>

    <title>Dependent places</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>dependent places</secondary></indexterm> In order to understand which places, if any, should be completely removed from a lujvo place structure, we need to understand the concept of dependent places. One place of a brivla is said to be dependent on another if its value can be predicted from the values of one or more of the other places. For example, the g2 place of 
    
    
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> is dependent on the g1 place. Why? Because when we know what fits in the g1 place (Spot, let us say, a well-known dog), then we know what fits in the g2 place ( 
    <quote>St. Bernard</quote>, let us say). In other words, when the value of the g1 place has been specified, the value of the g2 place is determined by it. Conversely, since each dog has only one breed, but each breed contains many dogs, the g1 place is not dependent on the g2 place; if we know only that some dog is a St. Bernard, we cannot tell by that fact alone which dog is meant.</para>
    <para>For 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, on the other hand, there is no dependency between the places. When we know the identity of a house-dweller, we have not determined the house, because a dweller may dwell in more than one house. By the same token, when we know the identity of a house, we do not know the identity of its dweller, for a house may contain more than one dweller.</para>

    <valsi>cakcinki</valsi> could be eliminated on the same reasoning that allowed us to eliminate the g2 place of 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> above. However, it is a rule that dependent places are not eliminated from a lujvo when they are derived from the tertau of its veljvo. This rule is imposed to keep the place structures of lujvo from drifting too far from the tertau place structure; if a place is necessary in the tertau, it's treated as necessary in the lujvo as well.</para>

Different place structures imply different concepts, and the lujvo maker may be trying to shoehorn the wrong concept into the place structure of his or her choosing. This is obvious when someone tries to shoehorn a 
    
    
    <valsi>klama</valsi> tertau into a 
    <valsi>litru</valsi> or 
    <valsi>cliva</valsi> concept, for example: these gismu differ in their number of arguments, and suppressing places of 
    <valsi>klama</valsi> in a lujvo doesn't make any sense if the resulting modified place structure is that of 
    <valsi>litru</valsi> or 
    <valsi>cliva</valsi>.</para>

    <title>lujvo with more than two parts.</title>
    <para> 


  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place order</primary><secondary>based on 3-or-more part veljvo</secondary></indexterm> The theory we have outlined so far is an account of lujvo with two parts. But often lujvo are made containing more than two parts. An example is 
    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi>, 
    <quote>tomorrow</quote>: it is composed of the rafsi for 
    
    <quote>future</quote>, 
    <quote>adjacent</quote>, and 
    <quote>day</quote>. How does the account we have given apply to lujvo like this?</para>
    <para>The best way to approach such lujvo is to continue to classify them as based on binary tanru, the only difference being that the seltau or the tertau or both is itself a lujvo. So it is easiest to make sense of 
    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi> as having two components: 
    <valsi>bavla'i</valsi>, 
    <quote>next</quote>, and 
    <valsi>djedi</valsi>. If we know or invent the lujvo place structure for the components, we can compose the new lujvo place structure in the usual way.</para>
    
    
    <para>In this case, 
    <valsi>bavla'i</valsi> is given the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-aCg7">

      </title>
      <para><definition>b1=l1 is next after b2=l2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>making it a symmetrical lujvo. We combine this with 
    <valsi>djedi</valsi>, which has the place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Lera">

    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>anomalous ordering of lujvo places</primary></indexterm> While symmetrical lujvo normally put any trailing tertau places before any seltau places, the day standard is a much less important concept than the day the tomorrow follows, in the definition of 
    
    <valsi>bavlamdei</valsi>. This is an example of how the guidelines presented for selecting and ordering lujvo places are just that, not laws that must be rigidly adhered to. In this case, we choose to rank places in order of relative importance. The resulting place structure is:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-KEwW">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e8d3"/>

  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>medieval weapon</primary></indexterm> Here is another example of a multi-part lujvo: 
    <valsi>cladakyxa'i</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>long-sword</quote>, a specific type of medieval weapon. The gismu place structures are:</para>

      <para>
      <valsi>dakfu</valsi>: d1 is a knife for cutting d2 with blade made of d3</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>xarci</valsi>: xa1 is a weapon for use against xa2 by wielder xa3</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>sword blade</primary></indexterm> Since 
    <valsi>cladakyxa'i</valsi> is a symmetrical lujvo based on 
    <jbophrase>cladakfu xarci</jbophrase>, and 
    <valsi>cladakfu</valsi> is itself a symmetrical lujvo, we can do the necessary analyses all at once. Plainly c1 (the long thing), d1 (the knife), and xa1 (the weapon) are all the same. Likewise, the d2 place (the thing cut) is the same as the xa2 place (the target of the weapon), given that swords are used to cut victims. Finally, the c2 place (direction of length) is always along the sword blade in a longsword, by definition, and so is dependent on c1=d1=xa1. Adding on the places of the remaining gismu in right-to-left order we get:</para>
    
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-eAbF">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e8d5"/>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>long-sword</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      </title>
      <para><definition>xa1=d1=c1 is a long-sword for use against xa2=d2 by wielder xa3, with a blade made of d3, length measured by standard c3.</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>If the last place sounds unimportant to you, notice that what counts legally as a 
    <quote>sword</quote>, rather than just a 
    <quote>knife</quote>, depends on the length of the blade (the legal limit varies in different jurisdictions). This fifth place of 
    <valsi>cladakyxa'i</valsi> may not often be explicitly filled, but it is still useful on occasion. Because it is so seldom important, it is best that it be last.</para>

    <title>Eliding SE rafsi from seltau</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>dropping SE rafsi</secondary></indexterm> It is common to form lujvo that omit the rafsi based on cmavo of selma'o SE, as well as other cmavo rafsi. Doing so makes lujvo construction for common or useful constructions shorter. Since it puts more strain on the listener who has not heard the lujvo before, the shortness of the word should not necessarily outweigh ease in understanding, especially if the lujvo refers to a rare or unusual concept.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>proposed law</primary></indexterm> Consider as an example the lujvo 
    <valsi>ti'ifla</valsi>, from the veljvo 
    <jbophrase>stidi flalu</jbophrase>, and meaning

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lined up</primary></indexterm> This lujvo does not fit any of our existing molds: it is the second seltau place, st2, that is equivalent to one of the tertau places, namely f1. However, if we understand 
    <valsi>ti'ifla</valsi> as an abbreviation for the lujvo 
    <valsi>selti'ifla</valsi>, then we get the first places of seltau and tertau lined up. The place structure of 
    
    <valsi>selti'i</valsi> is:</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>abbreviated</secondary></indexterm> Abbreviated lujvo like 
    <valsi>ti'ifla</valsi> are more intuitive (for the lujvo-maker) than their more explicit counterparts like 
    <valsi>selti'ifla</valsi> (as well as shorter). They don't require the coiner to sit down and work out the precise relation between the seltau and the tertau: he or she can just rattle off a rafsi pair. But should the lujvo get to the stage where a place structure needs to be worked out, then the precise relation does need to be specified. And in that case, such abbreviated lujvo form a trap in lujvo place ordering, since they obscure the most straightforward relation between the seltau and tertau. To give our lujvo-making guidelines as wide an application as possible, and to encourage analyzing the seltau-tertau relation in lujvo, lujvo like 
    
    
    
    
    
    <valsi>ti'ifla</valsi> are given the place structure they would have with the appropriate SE added to the seltau.</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo place structure</primary><secondary>effect of &quot;SE&quot;-dropping in tertau</secondary></indexterm> Eliding SE rafsi from tertau gets us into much more trouble. To understand why, recall that lujvo, following their veljvo, describe some type of whatever their tertau describe. Thus, 
    <valsi>posydji</valsi> describes a type of 
    <valsi>djica</valsi>, 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> describes a type of 
    <valsi>zdani</valsi>, and so on. What is certain is that 
    <valsi>gerzda</valsi> does not describe a 
    <jbophrase>se zdani</jbophrase>- it is not a word that could be used to describe an inhabitant such as a dog.</para>
    <para> 


 Now consider how we would translate the word 
    <quote>blue-eyed</quote>. Let's tentatively translate this word as 
    
    <valsi>blakanla</valsi> (from 
    <jbophrase>blanu kanla</jbophrase>, meaning 
    <quote>blue eye</quote>). But immediately we are in trouble: we cannot say</para>

    </example>
    <para>because Jack is not an eye, 
    <valsi>kanla</valsi>, but someone with an eye,

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>But look now at the place structure of 
    <valsi>blakanla</valsi>: it is a symmetrical lujvo, so the place structure is:</para>

      </title>
      <para><definition>bl1=k1 is a blue eye of bl2=k2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>We end up being most interested in talking about the second place, not the first (we talk much more of people than of their eyes), so 
    <valsi>se</valsi> would almost always be required.</para>
    <para>What is happening here is that we are translating the tertau wrongly, under the influence of English. The English suffix 
    <quote>-eyed</quote> does not mean 
    <quote>eye</quote>, but someone with an eye, which is 
    <valsi>selkanla</valsi>.</para>
    <para>Because we've got the wrong tertau (eliding a 
    <valsi>se</valsi> that really should be there), any attempt to accommodate the resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place structure is fitting a square peg in a round hole. Since they can be so misleading, lujvo with SE rafsi elided from the tertau should be avoided in favor of their more explicit counterparts: in this case, 
    <valsi>blaselkanla</valsi>.</para>

    <jbophrase>se klama</jbophrase>. But consider the related lujvo 
    <valsi>dzukla</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>to walk to somewhere</quote>. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo 
    <jbophrase>cadzu klama</jbophrase> as follows:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-4yG0">
      <title>

      <para><valsi>dzukla</valsi>: c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2</para>
    </example>
    <para>We can swap the k1 and k2 places using 
    <jbophrase>se dzukla</jbophrase>, but we cannot directly make 
    <jbophrase>se dzukla</jbophrase> into 
    <valsi>seldzukla</valsi>, which would represent the veljvo 
    <jbophrase>selcadzu klama</jbophrase> and plausibly mean something like 
    <quote>to go to a walking surface</quote>. Instead, we would need 
    <valsi>selkemdzukla</valsi>, with an explicit rafsi for 
    <valsi>ke</valsi>. Similarly, 
    <valsi>nalbrablo</valsi> (from 
    <jbophrase>na'e barda bloti</jbophrase>) means 
    <quote>non-big boat</quote>, whereas 
    
    <jbophrase>na'e brablo</jbophrase> means 
    <quote>other than a big boat</quote>.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo creation</primary><secondary>use of multiple SE in</secondary></indexterm> If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, 
    <valsi>gekmau</valsi> means 
    <quote>happier than</quote>, while 
    <valsi>selgekmau</valsi> means 
    <quote>making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than</quote>. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is 
    <jbophrase>se selgekmau</jbophrase>.</para>
    <para>But we can also say it is 
    <valsi>selselgekmau</valsi>. Two 
    <quote>se</quote> cmavo in a row cancel each other ( 
    <jbophrase>se se gleki</jbophrase> means the same as just 
    <valsi>gleki</valsi>), so there would be no good reason to have 
    <jbophrase>selsel</jbophrase> in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret 
    <jbophrase>selsel-</jbophrase> as 
    <jbophrase>selkemsel-</jbophrase>. The rafsi combinations 
    <jbophrase>terter-</jbophrase>, 
    <jbophrase>velvel-</jbophrase> and 
    <jbophrase>xelxel-</jbophrase> work in the same way.</para>
    <para>Other SE combinations like 
    <jbophrase>selter-</jbophrase>, although they might conceivably mean 
    <jbophrase>se te</jbophrase>, more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as 
    
    <jbophrase>se ke te</jbophrase>, since there is no need to re-order places in the way that 
    <jbophrase>se te</jbophrase> provides. (See

The place structure of

    <para>The lujvo

    <para>One use of abstract lujvo is to eliminate the need for explicit 
    
    <valsi>kei</valsi> in tanru: 
    <jbophrase>nunkalri gasnu</jbophrase> means much the same as

    <jbophrase>-hood</jbophrase> are represented with 
    <rafsi>nun-</rafsi> lujvo, and other words ending in 
    <quote>-ness</quote> or

    <rafsi>kam-</rafsi> lujvo (

    <para>There is also a rafsi for the cmavo

    <title>Implicit-abstraction lujvo</title>
    
    <para>Eliding NU rafsi involves the same restrictions as eliding SE rafsi, plus additional ones. In general, NU rafsi should not be elided from the tertau, since that changes the kind of thing the lujvo is talking about from an abstraction to a concrete sumti. However, they may be elided from the seltau if no reasonable ambiguity would result.</para>
    <para>A major difference, however, between SE elision and NU elision is that the former is a rather sparse process, providing a few convenient shortenings. Eliding 
    <valsi>nu</valsi>, however, is extremely important in producing a class of lujvo called 
    <quote>implicit-abstraction lujvo</quote>.</para>
    
    
    <para>Let us make a detailed analysis of the lujvo 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>to feed</quote>. (If you think this lujvo is excessively longwinded, be patient.) The veljvo of 
    
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> is 
    <jbophrase>nu citka kei gasnu</jbophrase>. The relevant place structures are:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-bSDW">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>nu</valsi>: n1 is an event</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>citka</valsi>: c1 eats c2</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>gasnu</valsi>: g1 does action/is the agent of event g2</para>
    </example>
    <para>In accordance with the procedure for analyzing three-part lujvo given in 
    <xref linkend="section-n-part-lujvo"/>, we will first create an intermediate lujvo, 
    <valsi>nuncti</valsi>, whose veljvo is 
    <jbophrase>nu citka [kei]</jbophrase>. By the rules given in 
    <xref linkend="section-abstraction-lujvo"/>, 
    <valsi>nuncti</valsi> has the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Xhrx">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d2"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>n1 is the event of c1 eating c2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>Now we can transform the veljvo of 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> into 
    <jbophrase>nuncti gasnu</jbophrase>. The g2 place (what is brought about by the actor g1) obviously denotes the same thing as n1 (the event of eating). So we can eliminate g2 as redundant, leaving us with a tentative place structure of</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-izvp">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d3"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>g1 is the actor in the event n1=g2 of c1 eating c2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>But it is also possible to omit the n1 place itself! The n1 place describes the event brought about; an event in Lojban is described as a bridi, by a selbri and its sumti; the selbri is already known (it's the seltau), and the sumti are also already known (they're in the lujvo place structure). So n1 would not give us any information we didn't already know. In fact, the n1=g2 place is dependent on c1 and c2 jointly &ndash; it does not depend on either c1 or c2 by itself. Being dependent and derived from the seltau, it is omissible. So the final place structure of 
    
    
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> is:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-9oTP">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d4"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>g1 is the actor in the event of c1 eating c2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>There is one further step that can be taken. As we have already seen with 
    <valsi>balsoi</valsi> in 
    <xref linkend="section-symmetrical-asymmetrical"/>, the interpretation of lujvo is constrained by the semantics of gismu and of their sumti places. Now, any asymmetrical lujvo with 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> as its tertau will involve an event abstraction either implicitly or explicitly, since that is how the g2 place of 
    
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> is defined.</para>
    <para>Therefore, if we assume that 
    <valsi>nu</valsi> is the type of abstraction one would expect to be a 
    <jbophrase>se gasnu</jbophrase>, then the rafsi 
    <rafsi>nun</rafsi> and 
    <rafsi>kez</rafsi> in 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi> are only telling us what we would already have guessed &ndash; that the seltau of a 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> lujvo is an event. If we drop these rafsi out, and use instead the shorter lujvo 
    <valsi>ctigau</valsi>, rejecting its symmetrical interpretation ( 
    <quote>someone who both does and eats</quote>; 
    <quote>an eating doer</quote>), we can still deduce that the seltau refers to an event.</para>
    <para>(You can't 
    <quote>do an eater</quote>/ 
    <jbophrase>gasnu lo citka</jbophrase>, with the meaning of 
    <valsi>do</valsi> as 
    <quote>bring about an event</quote>; so the seltau must refer to an event, 
    <jbophrase>nu citka</jbophrase>. The English slang meanings of 
    <quote>do someone</quote>, namely 
    <quote>socialize with someone</quote> and 
    <quote>have sex with someone</quote>, are not relevant to 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>.)</para>
    <para>So we can simply use 
    <valsi>ctigau</valsi> with the same place structure as 
    <valsi>nunctikezgau</valsi>:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-ITvd">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d5"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>agent g1 causes c1 to eat c2</definition></para>
      <para><definition>g1 feeds c2 to c1</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>This particular kind of asymmetrical lujvo, in which the seltau serves as the selbri of an abstraction which is a place of the tertau, is called an implicit-abstraction lujvo, because one deduces the presence of an abstraction which is unexpressed (implicit).</para>
    
    
    <para>To give another example: the gismu 
    <valsi>basti</valsi>, whose place structure is</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-3LIm">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d6"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>b1 replaces b2 in circumstances b3</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>can form the lujvo 
    <valsi>basygau</valsi>, with the place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-byp8">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d7"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>g1 (agent) replaces b1 with b2 in circumstances b3</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>where both 
    <valsi>basti</valsi> and 
    <valsi>basygau</valsi> are translated 
    <quote>replace</quote> in English, but represent different relations: 
    <valsi>basti</valsi> may be used with no mention of any agent doing the replacing.</para>
    <para>In addition, 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>-based lujvo can be built from what we would consider nouns or adjectives in English. In Lojban, everything is a predicate, so adjectives, nouns and verbs are all treated in the same way. This is consistent with the use of similar causative affixes in other languages. For example, the gismu 
    
    
    
    <valsi>litki</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>liquid</quote>, with the place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-tDsX">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d8"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>l1 is a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>can give 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>to liquefy</quote>:</para>
    
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-p5Bt">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d9"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>g1 (agent) causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3.</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>While 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi> correctly represents 
    <quote>causes to be a liquid</quote>, a different lujvo based on 
    <valsi>galfi</valsi> (meaning 
    <quote>modify</quote>) may be more appropriate for 
    <quote>causes to become a liquid</quote>. On the other hand, 
    <valsi>fetsygau</valsi> is potentially confusing, because it could mean 
    <quote>agent in the event of something becoming female</quote> (the implicit-abstraction interpretation) or simply 
    <quote>female agent</quote> (the parallel interpretation), so using implicit-abstraction lujvo is always accompanied with some risk of being misunderstood.</para>
    
    
    <para>Many other Lojban gismu have places for event abstractions, and therefore are good candidates for the tertau of an implicit-abstraction lujvo. For example, lujvo based on 
    
    
    
    <valsi>rinka</valsi>, with its place structure</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Pmz8">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e13d10"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>event r1 causes event r2 to occur</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>are closely related to those based on 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>. However, 
    <valsi>rinka</valsi> is less generally useful than 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi>, because its r1 place is another event rather than a person: 
    <jbophrase>lo rinka</jbophrase> is a cause, not a causer. Thus the place structure of 
    <valsi>likyri'a</valsi>, a lujvo analogous to 
    <valsi>likygau</valsi>, is</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-1HT3">
      <title>

      </title>
      <para>event r1 causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3</para>
    </example>
    <para>and would be useful in translating sentences like 
    <quote>The heat of the sun liquefied the block of ice.</quote></para>
    <para>Implicit-abstraction lujvo are a powerful means in the language of rendering quite verbose bridi into succinct and manageable concepts, and increasing the expressive power of the language.</para>

    <title>Anomalous lujvo</title>
    <para>Some lujvo that have been coined and actually employed in Lojban writing do not follow the guidelines expressed above, either because the places that are equivalent in the seltau and the tertau are in an unusual position, or because the seltau and tertau are related in a complex way, or both. An example of the first kind is 
    
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>prayer</quote>, which was mentioned in 
    <xref linkend="section-order-of-places"/>. The gismu places are:</para>

    <para>Now it is easy to see that the l2 and s2 places are equivalent: the believer in the religion (l2) is the one who expresses the prayer (s2). This is not one of the cases for which a place ordering rule has been given in

    <xref linkend="section-implicit-abstraction"/>; therefore, for lack of a better rule, we put the tertau places first and the remaining seltau places after them, leading to the place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-41dc">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d3"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>s1 is a prayer expressed by s2=l2 to audience s3 in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>The l3 place (the beliefs of the religion) is dependent on the l1 place (the religion) and so is omitted.</para>
    <para>We could make this lujvo less messy by replacing it with 
    <jbophrase>se seljdasku</jbophrase>, where 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi> is a normal symmetrical lujvo with place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-7Tdb">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e14d4"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition>c1=l2 religiously expresses prayer c2 to audience c3 in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para>which, according to the rule expressed in 
    <xref linkend="section-seltau-SE"/>, can be further expressed as 
    <valsi>selseljdasku</valsi>. However, there is no need for the ugly 
    <jbophrase>selsel-</jbophrase> prefix just to get the rules right: 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi> is a reasonable, if anomalous, lujvo.</para>
    <para>However, there is a further problem with 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi>, not resolvable by using 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi>. No veljvo involving just the two gismu 
    <valsi>lijda</valsi> and 
    <valsi>cusku</valsi> can fully express the relationship implicit in prayer. A prayer is not just anything said by the adherents of a religion; nor is it even anything said by them acting as adherents of that religion. Rather, it is what they say under the authority of that religion, or using the religion as a medium, or following the rules associated with the religion, or something of the kind. So the veljvo is somewhat elliptical.</para>
    <para>As a result, both 
    <valsi>seljdasku</valsi> and 
    <valsi>jdaselsku</valsi> belong to the second class of anomalous lujvo: the veljvo doesn't really supply all that the lujvo requires.</para>
    <para>Another example of this kind of anomalous lujvo, drawn from the tanru lists in 
    
    <xref linkend="section-asymmetric-tanru"/>, is 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>sheepdog</quote>. Clearly a sheepdog is not a dog which is a sheep (the symmetrical interpretation is wrong), nor a dog of the sheep breed (the asymmetrical interpretation is wrong). Indeed, there is simply no overlap in the places of 
    
    
    <valsi>lanme</valsi> and 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi> at all. Rather, the lujvo refers to a dog which controls sheep flocks, a 
    <jbophrase>terlanme jitro gerku</jbophrase>, the lujvo from which is 
    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> with place structure:</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-TW5Q">

      <para>
      <valsi>jitro</valsi>: j1 controls j2 in activity j3</para>
    </example>
    <para>Note that this lujvo is symmetrical between 
    <valsi>lantro</valsi> (sheep-controller) and 
    <valsi>gerku</valsi>, but 
    <valsi>lantro</valsi> is itself an asymmetrical lujvo. The l2 place, the breed of sheep, is removed as dependent on l1. However, the lujvo 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi> is both shorter than 
    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> and sufficiently clear to warrant its use: its place structure, however, should be the same as that of the longer lujvo, for which 
    <valsi>lange'u</valsi> can be understood as an abbreviation.</para>
    <para>Another example is 
    <valsi>xanmi'e</valsi>, 
    <quote>to command by hand, to beckon</quote>. The component place structures are:</para>

      <para>
      <valsi>minde</valsi>: m1 gives commands to m2 to cause m3 to happen</para>
      
    </example>
    <para>The relation between the seltau and tertau is close enough for there to be an overlap: xa2 (the person with the hand) is the same as m1 (the one who commands). But interpreting 
    
    <valsi>xanmi'e</valsi> as a symmetrical lujvo with an elided 
    <jbophrase>sel-</jbophrase> in the seltau, as if from 
    <jbophrase>se xance minde</jbophrase>, misses the point: the real relation expressed by the lujvo is not just 
    <quote>one who commands and has a hand</quote>, but 
    
    <quote>to command using the hand</quote>. The concept of 
    <quote>using</quote> suggests the gismu

    <valsi>terlantroge'u</valsi> above, even if he or she decides to stick with a shorter, more convenient form like

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>superlatives</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>comparatives</secondary></indexterm> English has the concepts of

    <para>We will begin with lujvo based on

    <para>In English, 
    <quote>more</quote> comparatives are easier to make and use than 
    
    <quote>less</quote> comparatives, but in Lojban the two forms are equally easy.</para>
    
    <para>Because of their much simpler place structure, lujvo ending in 
    <rafsi>-mau</rafsi> and 
    
    <rafsi>-me'a</rafsi> are in fact used much more frequently than 
    
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi> and 
    <valsi>mleca</valsi> themselves as selbri. It is highly unlikely for such lujvo to be construed as anything other than implicit-abstraction lujvo. But there is another type of ambiguity relevant to these lujvo, and which has to do with what is being compared.</para>
    
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>comparative lujvo</primary><secondary>potential ambiguity in</secondary></indexterm> For example, does 
    <valsi>nelcymau</valsi> mean 
    <quote>X likes Y more than X likes Z</quote>, or

    <valsi>klamau</valsi> mean: 
    <quote>X goes to Y more than to Z</quote>, 
    <quote>X goes to Y more than Z does</quote>, 
    <quote>X goes to Y from Z more than from W</quote>, or what?</para>

In that way, each of the different possible interpretations can be expressed by SE-converting the seltau, and making the required place the new first place. As a result, we get the following comparative lujvo place structures:</para>
    
    
    
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-eSTr">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e15d6"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>nelcymau</valsi>: z1, more than z2, likes n2 by amount z4</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>selnelcymau</valsi>: z1, more than z2, is liked by n1 in amount z4</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>klamau</valsi>: z1, more than z2, goes to k2 from k3 via k4 by means of k5</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>selklamau</valsi>: z1, more than z2, is gone to by k1 from k3 via k4 by means of k5</para>
      <para>
      <valsi>terklamau</valsi>: z1, more than z2, is an origin point from destination k2 for k1's going via k4 by means of k5</para>
    </example>
    <para>(See 
    <xref linkend="chapter-abstractions"/> for the way in which this problem is resolved when lujvo aren't used.)</para>
    <para>The ordering rule places the things being compared first, and the other seltau places following. Unfortunately the z4 place, which expresses by how much one entity exceeds the other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is different for each lujvo. For example, while 
    <valsi>nelcymau</valsi> has z4 as its fourth place, 
    <valsi>klamau</valsi> has it as its sixth place. In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place can be redundantly tagged with 
    <valsi>vemau</valsi> (for 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi>) or 
    <valsi>veme'a</valsi> (for 
    <valsi>mleca</valsi>) to help make the speaker's intention clear.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>comparative lujvo</primary><secondary>and seltau presupposition</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>octogenarian</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>nonagenarian</primary></indexterm> It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do not presuppose their seltau. Just as in English, saying someone is younger than someone else doesn't imply that they're young in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still younger than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a greater 
    
    
    
    
    
    <jbophrase>ni citno</jbophrase> than the 90-year-old. Similarly, a 5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not considered 
    <quote>old</quote> by most standards.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>comparative lujvo</primary><secondary>against former state</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>former state</primary></indexterm> There are some comparative concepts which are in which the 
    <jbophrase>se zmadu</jbophrase> is difficult to specify. Typically, these involve comparisons implicitly made with a former state of affairs, where stating a z2 place explicitly would be problematic.</para>
    
    <para>In such cases, it is best not to use 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi> and leave the comparison hanging, but to use instead the gismu 
    
    <valsi>zenba</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>increase</quote> (and 
    <valsi>jdika</valsi>, meaning 
    <quote>decrease</quote>, in place of 
    <valsi>mleca</valsi>). The gismu 
    <valsi>zenba</valsi> was included in the language precisely in order to capture those notions of increase which 
    <valsi>zmadu</valsi> can't quite cope with; in addition, we don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru on something that we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate 
    <quote>I'm stronger now</quote> not as</para>

    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>place structure</primary><secondary>gismu</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place structures</secondary></indexterm> Unlike the place structures of lujvo, the place structures of gismu were assigned in a far less systematic way through a detailed case-by-case analysis and repeated reviews with associated changes. (The gismu list is now baselined, so no further changes are contemplated.) Nevertheless, certain regularities were imposed both in the choice of places and in the ordering of places which may be helpful to the learner and the lujvo-maker, and which are therefore discussed here.</para>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place structures</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> The choice of gismu places results from the varying outcome of four different pressures: brevity, convenience, metaphysical necessity, and regularity. (These are also to some extent the underlying factors in the lujvo place structures generated by the methods of this chapter.) The implications of each are roughly as follows:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Brevity tends to remove places: the fewer places a gismu has, the easier it is to learn, and the less specific it is. As mentioned in 
        <xref linkend="section-selecting-places"/>, a brivla with fewer place structures is less specific, and generality is a virtue in gismu, because they must thoroughly blanket all of semantic space.</para>
        
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Convenience tends to increase the number of places: if a concept can be expressed as a place of some existing gismu, there is no need to make another gismu, a lujvo or a fu'ivla for it.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Metaphysical necessity can either increase or decrease places: it is a pressure tending to provide the 
        <quote>right number</quote> of places. If something is part of the essential nature of a concept, then a place must be made for it; on the other hand, if instances of the concept need not have some property, then this pressure will tend to remove the place.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regularity is a pressure which can also either increase or decrease places. If a gismu has a given place, then gismu which are semantically related to it are likely to have the place also.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Here are some examples of gismu place structures, with a discussion of the pressures operating on them:</para>

      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>xekri</valsi>: xe1 is black</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>color standards</primary></indexterm> Brevity was the most important goal here, reinforced by one interpretation of metaphysical necessity. There is no mention of color standards here, as many people have pointed out; like all color gismu, 
    
    <valsi>xekri</valsi> is explicitly subjective. Objective color standards can be brought in by an appropriate BAI tag such as 
    
    <valsi>ci'u</valsi> ( 
    
    <quote>in system</quote>; see 
    <xref linkend="section-BAI"/>) or by making a lujvo.</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-cuYP">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e16d2"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>jbena</valsi>: j1 is born to j2 at time j3 and location j4</para>
    </example>
    <para>The gismu 
    <valsi>jbena</valsi> contains places for time and location, which few other gismu have: normally, the time and place at which something is done is supplied by a tense tag (see 
    <xref linkend="chapter-tenses"/>). However, providing these places makes 
    <jbophrase>le te jbena</jbophrase> a simple term for 
    <quote>birthday</quote> and 
    <jbophrase>le ve jbena</jbophrase> for 
    <quote>birthplace</quote>, so these places were provided despite their lack of metaphysical necessity.</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-NTJn">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e16d3"/>
      </title>
      <para>
      <valsi>rinka</valsi>: event r1 is the cause of event r2</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>melting</primary></indexterm> The place structure of 
    <valsi>rinka</valsi> does not have a place for the agent, the one who causes, as a result of the pressure toward metaphysical necessity. A cause-effect relationship does not have to include an agent: an event (such as snow melting in the mountains) may cause another event (such as the flooding of the Nile) without any human intervention or even knowledge.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>lujvo</primary><secondary>as suppliers of agent place</secondary></indexterm> Indeed, there is a general tendency to omit agent places from most gismu except for a few such as 
    <valsi>gasnu</valsi> and 
    <valsi>zukte</valsi> which are then used as tertau in order to restore the agent place when needed: see 
    <xref linkend="section-implicit-abstraction"/>.</para>
    <example xml:id="example-random-id-Atby">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c12e16d4"/>
      </title>
      <para><definition><valsi>cinfo</valsi>: c1 is a lion of species/breed c2</definition></para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>diversified species</primary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>general terms</primary></indexterm> The c2 place of 
    <valsi>cinfo</valsi> is provided as a result of the pressure toward regularity. All animal and plant gismu have such an x2 place; although there is in fact only one species of lion, and breeds of lion, though they exist, aren't all that important in talking about lions. The species/breed place must exist for such diversified species as dogs, and for general terms like 
    
    
    <valsi>cinki</valsi> (insect), and are provided for all other animals and plants as a matter of regularity.</para>
    
    <para> <indexterm type="general-imported"><primary>gismu</primary><secondary>place order</secondary><tertiary>rationale</tertiary></indexterm> Less can be said about gismu place structure ordering, but some regularities are apparent. The places tend to appear in decreasing order of psychological saliency or importance. There is an implication within the place structure of 
    <valsi>klama</valsi>, for example, that 
    <jbophrase>lo klama</jbophrase> (the one going) will be talked about more often, and is thus more important, than 
    <jbophrase>lo se klama</jbophrase> (the destination), which is in turn more important than 
    
    <jbophrase>lo xe klama</jbophrase> (the means of transport).</para>
    <para>Some specific tendencies (not really rules) can also be observed. For example, when there is an agent place, it tends to be the first place. Similarly, when a destination and an origin point are mentioned, the destination is always placed just before the origin point. Places such as 
    
    <quote>under conditions</quote> and 
    <quote>by standard</quote>, which often go unfilled, are moved to near the end of the place structure.</para>
