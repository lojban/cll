==================
  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Ok, things are a lot more miscellaneous now, and require a lot more
care and attention.

First off, 

  YOU MUST READ "README-tags"

in its entirety.  The rest of this won't make sense until you do.
If that document seems confusing, feel free to bug
rlpowell/camgusmis or zort, but it may mean you're not cut out to
help at this stage.

IF YOU CHANGE, ADD, OR REMOVE ANY ACTUAL CONTENT, I WILL EAT YOUR
FAMILY.  WITH STEAK SAUCE.  MMMMMM.

If you make a change that is not *solely* XML tags, that's a content
change, and I will hunt you down and bad things will occur.

 ------

==================
  Non-Visual Issues
==================

Deal with all the <oldjbophrase> crap.  This is probably the single
biggest remaining chunk of work.

Basically every use of <lojbanization> has <jbo> for the first
entry, when it should actually be <natlang>.

All instances of <definition> need to be checked, because many of
them do not, in fact, denote definitions (in which case they should
be replaced be <quote>).

 ------
 
Entries like <indexterm type="example-imported"> (NOTE the type)
need to be moved into examples.

They have been seperated out by blank lines to make it easier.

Especially things like this:

  <para> <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>lemon tree</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm> FIXME: TAG SPOT</para>

which are artificial paragraphs solely for index importing.

All such indexterm entries should end up in the example itself, like so:

  <title>
    <indexterm type="example"><primary>lemon tree</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
    <anchor xml:id="c5e2d1"/>
  </title>

NOTE THE CHANGE OF TYPE on the indexterm.

 ------

The per-section cmavo lists should be like this:
   <cmavo-list>
     <cmavo-entry>
       <cmavo>ke</cmavo>
       <selmaho>KE</selmaho>
       <description>start grouping</description>
     </cmavo-entry>
   ...
   </cmavo-list>

All the imported/manual indexterm entries for single words or
selma'o need to be checked; they should be covered adequately by
nearby <cmavo-list> or <valsi> entries, both of which create index
entries.  If you don't know how to search for only the relevant
entries in your particular text editor, come on #jbopre and ask.

Clean up the "FIXME: TAG SPOT" bits.  Those were put there as part
of the semi-automated index insertion project.  If there's an
<indexterm> next to them, great; kill it.  If there isn't, maybe
look around nearby and make sure that obvious <valsi> tags and
similar are in use.

Similarily, entries like <indexterm type="lojban-word-imported">
(NOTE the type) probably need to be destroyed; there should be a bit
of Lojban near them that can be wrapped in <valsi>, to exactly the
same effect as the <indexterm> entry.  If you can't find such a
correspondance, add a FIXME comment.

Hunt down all FIXME:s and <!-- ... --> with todo type comments.
That's all going to be advanced shit, though.

==================
  Visual Issues
==================

After we're done with all that, we need to actually make it look
nice.  That's going to be quite a bit of work, and mostly on the
XSLT end of things, but here are some things you can do to maybe
help (you're certainly free to hack the XSLT if you know how,
though).

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right in the output (which
is why the columns are so spaced out).

==================
  Data
==================
- It seems that there is a problem with the cmavo lists at the
  beginning of sections having missing entries; in particular, ones
  wwith +/* in the selma'o, maybe?; they need to be manually checked
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index
- list the members of each selma'o in chapter 20
- <phrase role="IPA">∞</phrase> is *not* IPA
- In the mediaobjects in chapter 1, can we do better than <alt>The
  picture for chapter 20</alt> in terms of non-numerical cross
  referencing?
- Fix all FIXMEs; in particular the output of:
  grep 'FIXME:' [0-9]*.xml | grep -v 'TAG SPOT'

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chapter 5
- print: Add a header or footer to the left or the right page that
  has the number of the chapter you're in.

- for chapter 13, needs code changes to handle things like this:

      <cmavo-entry>
        <cmavo>fu'i</cmavo>
        <gismu>[frili]</gismu>
        <attitudinal-scale point="sai">with help</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="sai">easily</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="cu'i">without help</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="nai">with opposition</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="nai">with difficulty</attitudinal-scale>
      </cmavo-entry>

  the way the red book does

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
  - Ideally, make sure they are autogenerated as part of the HTML
    production.
- Similarily, generate more-readable anchors based on current
  section number and such
