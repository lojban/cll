removing.  Might be nice to re-apply * cb87291250fa978bcb67f965bfb880601ce9f367
Chapter 6 lojban-word-importeds. for this.

Handling chapter 2: why don't we just require that the number of sub-entries matches?
  Also: maybe rename jbo/gloss for this purpose, or introduce roles.

==================
  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Most of the below is intended to be done as needed as you review a
particular chapter/section.  It looks like more complexity than it
actually is; you'll get used to it.

    SAY HERE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, including parts you haven't completed
    (like index work).

Robin Powell: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
Zort: All chapters except 20 & 21 excepting index stuff (plenty of FIXMEs, though)
Matthew Walton: 3

 ------

IF YOU CHANGE, ADD, OR REMOVE ANY ACTUAL CONTENT, I WILL EAT YOUR
FAMILY.  WITH STEAK SAUCE.  MMMMMM.

If you make a change that is not *solely* XML tags, that's a content
change, and I will hunt you down and bad things will occur.

 ------

Ignore Chapter 2 for now.

 ------

If you have any trouble, add a FIXME comment, like so:

<!-- FIXME: detailed explanation here -->

 ------

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right in the output (which
is why the columns are so spaced out).

 ------

References to examples in the text should be changed to <xref>s, using
the random id of the example in question, e.g. <xref linkend="example-random-id-qjmr"/>

The important thing here is that *NOTHING* mentions a fixed number!
*NOWHERE* in the docbook should *ANYTHING* be aware that it is in
chapter 20 or section 7 or anything like that.  This is to give us
the freedom to move things around later.

Numeric-based stuff will all be autogenerated during processing,
based on the current state of the docs.

THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION: DO NOT change anchors that are one to three
pairs of letters and numbers, like this:

  <anchor xml:id="c5e1d5" />

They are going to be needed down the road to provide backwards
compatability.  Don't touch them.

 ------

Feel free to do visual cleanup *of the source*; don't worry about
how crappy the *output* looks, we're only doing data structures
right now.  In particular, there are a lot of elements with no space
after their terminators; it doesn't really matter, but it's
annoying.

 ------

If you see a <quote>...</quote> around Lojban text, replace it with
<jbophrase>...</jbophrase>.  There are lots of these.

Also, use <jbophrase valid="false">...</jbophrase> for purposeful na
gendra and <jbophrase valid="iffy">...</jbophrase> for na smudra

Turn Lojban letters, like <quote>l</quote>, into <jbophrase
role="letteral">l</jbophrase> (including ",", ".", and "'").

Similarily we have role="morphology" (consonant clusters),
role="diphthong", and role="rafsi".

 ------

<programlisting> is bad; change it.  If you can't figure out how to
change it, or think it's actually correct in some particular place,
post to the BPFK list.

 ------

If an example/interlinear-gloss consists solely of English, replace
the <interlinear-gloss>...</interlinear-gloss> with <para>...</para>

 ------

Make sure all the components of <example>s are appropriately wrapped in
<jbo>, <gloss>, <en>, <ipa>, <math>, or <foreign> (if it doesn't fit
one of those, make up a tag).

 ------
 
Entries like <indexterm type="lojban-word-imported"> (NOTE the type)
probably need to be destroyed; there should be a bit of Lojban near
them that can be wrapped in <jbophrase>, to exactly the same effect
as the <indexterm> entry, UNLESS said Lojban text is part of a bigger
Lojban phrase; leave those for now. If you can't find such a correspondance,
add a FIXME comment.

 ------
 
Entries like <indexterm type="example-imported"> (NOTE the type)
need to be moved into examples.

Especially things like this:

  <para> <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>lemon tree</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm> FIXME: TAG SPOT</para>

which are artificial paragraphs solely for index importing.

All such indexterm entries should end up in the example itself, like so:

  <title>
    <indexterm type="example-imported"><primary>lemon tree</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
    <anchor xml:id="c5e2d1"/>
  </title>

 ------

==================
  Data
==================
- The per-section cmavo lists should be like this:
   <cmavo-list>
     <cmavo-entry>
       <cmavo>ke</cmavo>
       <selmaho>KE</selmaho>
       <description>start grouping</description>
     </cmavo-entry>
   ...
   </cmavo-list>
  - also need to wrap the lojban words there in a way that does
    indexing, and ideally auto-generation of the cmavo-per-selmaho
    lists we want for chapter 20
      - does the <cmavo-list> structure achieve this?
- It seems that there is a problem with the cmavo lists at the
  beginning of sections having missing entries; in particular, ones
  wwith +/* in the selma'o, maybe?; they need to be manually checked
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index
- cll_chapter5-section1 should be content-words-brivla or so ; those
  IDs should not change when things are moved around
- list the members of each selma'o in chapter 20
- make sure the examples that aren't interlinear glosses don't have
  that as their role
   - so far there's
      - pronunciation-example
      - compound-cmavo-example
      - lujvo-making-example
      - lojbanization-example
      - lujvo-example
- <phrase role="IPA">âˆž</phrase> is *not* IPA
- <@xalbo> I do think having distinct structures for quoted correct
  lojban and for intentionally incorrect lojban (if there's any, but
  I would expect there is) would probably be a good thing. <@xalbo>
  (found one: search for djeimz) <@xalbo> I see three cases, though
  I don't know if they're all represented in the text: valid, good
  lojban, invalid lojban, and something in between ({lo nanmu
  bajra}, for instance; maybe worth flagging with a "this isn't what
  you think it is" type of thing
  - use <jbophrase valid="false">...</jbophrase> for purposeful na
      gendra and <jbophrase valid="iffy">...</jbophrase> for na smudra
- In the mediaobjects in chapter 1, can we do better than <alt>The
  picture for chapter 20</alt> in terms of non-numerical cross
  referencing?
- Replace chapter xrefs with section xrefs
- Fix all FIXMEs; in particular the output of:
  grep 'FIXME:' [0-9]*.xml | grep -v 'TAG SPOT'

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chapter 5
- print: Add a header or footer to the left or the right page that
  has the number of the chapter you're in.

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
  - Ideally, make sure they are autogenerated as part of the HTML
    production.
- Similarily, generate more-readable anchors based on current
  section number and such
