  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Ok, things are a lot more miscellaneous now, and require a lot more
care and attention.

First off, 

  YOU MUST READ "README-tags"

in its entirety.  The rest of this won't make sense until you do.
If that document seems confusing, feel free to bug
rlpowell/camgusmis or zort, but it may mean you're not cut out to
help at this stage.

IF YOU CHANGE, ADD, OR REMOVE ANY ACTUAL CONTENT, I WILL EAT YOUR
FAMILY.  WITH STEAK SAUCE.  MMMMMM.

If you make a change that is not *solely* XML tags, that's a content
change, and I will hunt you down and bad things will occur.

13. Section 7: table has values flowing into extra columns instead of rows
13. Vocatives table puts the large paragraphs explaining the vocatives onto the existing table rows
14. Logical group letters are merely capitals; they need to stand out much better

16. After Example 16.93: plurals with spaces between the valsi and the "s"
17. Letters table is ridiculously tall
18. Examples are missing numeric rows
18. Section 6 cmavo list: mo'o is in the wrong row

==================
  Non-Visual Issues
==================

The <definition> tags within tables have their <valsi> component in another column of the table.  We need to decide whether is this is
satisfactory, or if something else should be done with them.

 ------
 
All the imported/manual indexterm entries for single words or
selma'o need to be checked; they should be covered adequately by
nearby <cmavo-list> or <valsi> entries, both of which create index
entries.  If you don't know how to search for only the relevant
entries in your particular text editor, come on #jbopre and ask.

 ------

Clean up the "FIXME: TAG SPOT" bits.  Those were put there as part
of the semi-automated index insertion project.  If there's an
<indexterm> next to them, great; kill it.  If there isn't, maybe
look around nearby and make sure that obvious <valsi> tags and
similar are in use.

 ------

Similarily, entries like <indexterm type="lojban-word-imported">
(NOTE the type) probably need to be destroyed; there should be a bit
of Lojban near them that can be wrapped in <valsi>, to exactly the
same effect as the <indexterm> entry.  If you can't find such a
correspondance, add a FIXME comment.

 ------

Hunt down all FIXME:s and <!-- ... --> with todo type comments.
That's all going to be advanced shit, though.

==================
  Visual Issues
==================

After we're done with all that, we need to actually make it look
nice.  That's going to be quite a bit of work, and mostly on the
XSLT end of things, but here are some things you can do to maybe
help (you're certainly free to hack the XSLT if you know how,
though).

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right in the output (which
is why the columns are so spaced out).

==================
  Data
==================
- It seems that there is a problem with the cmavo lists at the
  beginning of sections having missing entries; in particular, ones
  wwith +/* in the selma'o, maybe?; they need to be manually checked
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index
- list the members of each selma'o in chapter 20
- <phrase role="IPA">∞</phrase> is *not* IPA
- In the mediaobjects in chapter 1, can we do better than <alt>The
  picture for chapter 20</alt> in terms of non-numerical cross
  referencing?
- there's a bunch of problems in 18.xml ; a lot of math stuff has
  gotten truncated in the final form.  they basically all need to be
  checked; having a CLL to hand would help
- Fix all FIXMEs; in particular the output of:
  grep 'FIXME:' [0-9]*.xml | grep -v 'TAG SPOT'

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chapter 5
- print: Add a header or footer to the left or the right page that
  has the number of the chapter you're in.

- for chapter 13, needs code changes to handle things like this:

      <cmavo-entry>
        <cmavo>fu'i</cmavo>
        <gismu>[frili]</gismu>
        <attitudinal-scale point="sai">with help</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="sai">easily</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="cu'i">without help</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="nai">with opposition</attitudinal-scale>
        <attitudinal-scale point="nai">with difficulty</attitudinal-scale>
      </cmavo-entry>

  the way the red book does

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
  - Ideally, make sure they are autogenerated as part of the HTML
    production.
- Similarily, generate more-readable anchors based on current
  section number and such
