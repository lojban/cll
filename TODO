==================
  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Ok, things are a lot more miscellaneous now, and require a lot more
care and attention.

First off, 

  YOU MUST READ "README-tags"

in its entirety.  The rest of this won't make sense until you do.
If that document seems confusing, feel free to bug
rlpowell/camgusmis or zort, but it may mean you're not cut out to
help at this stage.

IF YOU CHANGE, ADD, OR REMOVE ANY ACTUAL CONTENT, I WILL EAT YOUR
FAMILY.  WITH STEAK SAUCE.  MMMMMM.

If you make a change that is not *solely* XML tags, that's a content
change, and I will hunt you down and bad things will occur.

 ------

All todos now live in the [GitHub issue tracker][1]. These are to be
tackled in the following order in general:

1. "Markup issues"
2. "Data issues"
3. "Output tweaks"
   (used to be filed under the "Display" heading in this file)
4. "Visual issues"
5. "Errata & content issues"

Look at the [milestones page][2] for more details.
