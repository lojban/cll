        <h3><a id="s3" name="s3">3. Words that can act as sumti</h3>

  <p>Here is a short table of single words used as sumti. This
  table provides examples only, not the entire set of such words,
  which may be found in 
  <a href="../c7/s1.html">Chapter 7</a>

  .</p>

<pre>
   mi  I/me, we/us
    do  you
    ti  this, these
    ta  that, those
    tu  that far away, those far away
    zo'e    unspecified value (used when a sumti is
            unimportant or obvious)
</pre>

  <p>Lojban sumti are not specific as to number (singular or
  plural), nor gender (masculine/feminine/neutral). Such
  distinctions can be optionally added by methods that are beyond
  the scope of this chapter.</p>

  <p>The cmavo ``ti'', ``ta'', and ``tu'' refer to whatever the
  speaker is pointing at, and should not be used to refer to things
  that cannot in principle be pointed at.</p>

  <p>Names may also be used as sumti, provided they are preceded
  with the word ``la'':</p>

<pre>
   la meris.   the one/ones named Mary
    la djan.    the one/ones named John
</pre>

  <p>Other Lojban spelling versions are possible for names from
  other languages, and there are restrictions on which letters may
  appear in Lojban names: see 
  <a href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>

  for more information.</p>
