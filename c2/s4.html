</pre>

  Each selbri (relation) has a specific rule that defines the role
  of each sumti in the bridi, based on its position. In the table
  above, that order was expressed by labeling the sumti positions
  as x1, x2, x3, and x4. 
  <p>Like the table in 
  <a href="s3.html">Section 3</a>

  , this table is far from complete: in fact, no complete table can
  exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created (in
  specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing
  supply of words inadequate. This notion is a basic difference
  between Lojban (and some other languages such as German and
  Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very leery of
  using words that ``aren't in the dictionary''. Lojbanists are
  encouraged to invent new words; doing so is a major way of
  participating in the development of the language.

  <a href="../c12/s1.html">Chapter 12</a>

  explains how to give them appropriate meanings.</p>
